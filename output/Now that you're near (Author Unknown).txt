i stand before you Lord
And give you all my praise
your love is all I need
Jesus you're all I need

My life belongs to you
You gave your ife for me
Your grace is all I need
Jesus youre all I need

Hold me in your arms
Never let me go
I want to spend eternity with you

Now that you're near everything is different
Everything's so different, Lord

I know I'm not the same, my life you've changed
i want to be with you, I want to be with you

I will sing for you always
Cause in your presense God is where I want to stay
