We will worship the Lamb of glory
We will worship the King of kings
We will worship the Lamb of glory
We will worship the King

And with our hands lifted high,
We will worship and sing
And with our hands lifted high,
We come before You rejoicing.
With our hands lifted high to the sky
When the world wonders why
We'll just tell them we're loving our King...Oh
We'll just tell them that we're loving our King
