There's a new song arisin' in the hearts of His children
A new song arisin' in the hearts of His own
Theres a new song arisin' in the hearts of His children
A new song arisin' in the hearts of his own

A song of hope a song of peace
the sound liberation the shout of victory
The hym of praise, the new song of God
many will see and fear and put thier trust in our Lord

With the oil of joy he's annointng his children
The music he gives sets the nations free
With the oil of joy he's annointing his children
and the dance of our father's bringing liberty
