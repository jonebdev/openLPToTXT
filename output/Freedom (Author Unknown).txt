Where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is freedom
Where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is freedom
There is peace, there is love, there is joy
It is for freedom you've set us free
It is for freedom you've set us free

I'm free (4X)

So we will walk in your freedom, walk in your liberty
So we will walk in your freedom, walk in your liberty
So we will dance in your freedom, dance in your liberty
So we will dance in your freedom, dance in your liberty
