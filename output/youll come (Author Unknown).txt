I have decided
I have resolved
To wait upon you Lord
My rock and redeemer
shield and reward,
I'll wait upon you Lord

As surely as the sun will rise
You'll come to us
Certain as the dawn apears

You'll come
Let your glory fall
As you respond to us
Spirit Reign
Flood into our thirst hearts again
You'll come
You'll come

We are not shaken
We are not moved
We wait upon you Lord
Our mighty deliverer
Our triumph and truth
We wait upon you Lord

As surely as the sun will rise
You'll come to us
Certain as your word endures

Chains be broken
Lives be healed
Eyes be opened
Christ is revealed
