You crossed the great divide,
You took our place,
You offered up Your life though we have failed
The veil was torn and love remained
You are Holy, Lord.

Distraction costs us, how we seek your face
We offer up our lives to bring you praise
A love the walls cannot contain
You are holy Lord

We're rising up in Spirit
and in truth
A living sacrifice
We worship You
People undivided, Lord hear us sing
We are yours and You are our King.

This is our love,
Hearts joined as one
Desperate for all your are
Lord break down these walls
And see how we love
Desperate for all you are
We chase Your heart

We didn't come to leave here entertained
Or worship under any other name
We're crying our for you alone
You are holy Lord

Show us the way to your heart,
We found our voice
we found our cause
we're on our knees, the carper's worm
We join our hearts
with distant shores and sing to you Lord.
