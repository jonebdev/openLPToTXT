All who are thirsty
All who are weak
Come to the fountain
Dip your heart in the Stream of Life.

Let the pain and the sorrow,
Be washed away,
In the waves of His mercy
As deep cries out to deep...

Come, Lord Jesus, Come,
Come, Lord Jesus, Come,
Come, Lord Jesus, Come,
Come, Lord Jesus, Come,

Holy Spirit, Come.
Holy Spirit, Come
Holy Spirit, Come
Holy Spirit, Come

As deep cries out to deep.
As deep cries out to deep.
As deep cries out to deep. (we sing...)
