A mighty fortress is our God,
A bulwark never failing,
A bulwark never failing,
Bulwark never failing,
A bulwark never failing,
A bulwark never failing,
A bulwark never failing.

Our helper He amid the,
Flood our helper He,
Our helper amid the flood,
Of mortal ills prevailing,
Mid mortal ills prevailing,

For still our ancient foe,
For still our ancient foe,
Doth seek for us woe,
Doth seek for us woe,
With craft and great might,
With craft and great might,

Armed with cruel hate,
And armed with cruel hate,
And armed with cruel hate,
On earth is none His equal,
On earth is none equal.
