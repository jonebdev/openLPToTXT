I'm in a fight not physical
And Im'm in a war,but not with this world
You are the light that's beautiful
And I want more, I want all that's Yours


Joy unspeakable that won't go away
And Just enough strength to live for today
So I never have to worry what tomorrow will bring
'Cause my faith is on solid rock, I am counting on God

I am counting on, I am counting on God
I am counting on, I am counting on God
I am counting on, I am counting on God
I am counting on, I am counting on God

And the miracle of Christ in me
Is the mystery that sets me free
I'm nothing like I used to be
Just open up your eyes, you'll see
