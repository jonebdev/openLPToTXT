Angels from the realms of glory,
Wing your flight o'er all the earth;
Ye who sang creation's story,
Now proclaim Messiah's birth.
Come and worship, come and worship;
Worship Christ, the new-born King!

Shepherds in the fields abiding,
Watching o'er your flocks by night;
God with man is now residing,
Yonder shines the infant Light.
Come and worship, come and worship;
Worship Christ, the new-born King!

Sages, leave your contemplation's,
Brighter visions beam afar;
Seek the great Desire of nations,
Ye have seen His natal star.
Come and worship, come and worship;
Worship Christ, the new-born King!

Saints, before the altar bending,
Watching long in hope and fear;
Suddenly the Lord, descending,
In His temple shall appear.
Come and worship, come and worship;
Worship Christ, the new-born King!

All creation, join in praising,
God, the Father, Spirit, Son;
Evermore your voices raising,
To the eternal Three in One.
Come and worship, come and worship;
Worship Christ, the new-born King!
