All for Love a father gave
For only love could make a way
All for Love the heaven's cried
For love was crucified

Oh, how many times have I broken your heart?
But still you forgive, if only I ask
And how many time have you heard me pray?
Draw near to me

Everything I need is you
My beginning my forever
Everything I need is you

Let me sing all for love
I will join the angel's song
Ever Holy is the Lord
King of Glory, King of all

All for Love a saviour prayed
Abba, Father have your way.
Though they know not what they do
Let the cross draw men to you
