Job 2:10
Job 1:21
2 Corinthians 8:2-6

You've done it. You have finally achieved all the goals you've created for yourself. You have a beautiful, loving spouse who you are madly in love with, two adoring children, a spacious home, a great, secure job, and most of all you've got a great relationship with your maker-- you could not be happier. You finally achieved everything in life that you ever wanted and there is not one thing lacking in your life.

One day, you wake up to find your life is falling to pieces. You lose your job, your home gets forclosed on, you lose your family to a car accident. In an instant, everything changes and the only thing you have left is GOD.

In hard times, it is so much easier to blame God or ask God why than to turn to him or to trust that he will turn your situation to good. Sometimes, God allows trials in our lives so that he can shine through your situation. The most important thing is not how your situation turns out, but what you do during it.

Could you still Bless his name?
How would you feel? betrayed? abandoned? trusting?
Would you turn your back on God or would you run to him?
Would you be able, in your misery, to share your story with others?
