Your love is everlasting; it's an everlasting love
Your mercy is as new as every rising of the sun
And Your loving kindness, loving kindness is better than life!

Your grace is all-sufficient; it's an all sufficent grace
Your power and Your glory are forever on display
And Your loving kindness, loving kindness is better than life!

Oh-- it's better, Oh--
better than life
Oh-- so much better, Jesus,
Your loving kindness is better than life

Fairest of ten thousand, of ten thousand you are fair
And nothing in this world could ever measure or compare
To Your loving kindness, Your loving kindness is better than life!

All Your ways are just, oh Lord, You're just in all Your ways
And I will lift my hands, oh Lord, in gratitude and praise
For Your loving kindness, loving kindness is better than life!

Jesus, Your loving kindness, -- is better than life itself
Better than life itself
Jesus, Your loving kindness, -- is better than life itself
Better than life itself
