Draw me Close to you,
Never let me go,
I'll lay it all down again
To hear you say that I'm your friend.

You are my desire,
No one else will do
Cause no one else could take your place
I feel the warmth of your embrace
Help me find the way
Lead me back to you..

You're all I want
You're all I've ever needed
You're all I want
Help me know that You are never
