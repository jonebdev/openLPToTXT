All people that on earth do dwell,
Sing to the Lord with cheerful voice;
Him serve with fear His praise forth tell,
Come ye before Him and rejoice.

The Lord, ye know, is God indeed,
Without our aid He did us make;
We are His flock, He doth us fee
And for His sheep He doth us take.

O, enter then His gates with praise,
Approach with joy His courts unto;
Praise laud and bless His name always,
For it is seemly so to do.

For why the Lord our God is good,
His mercy is forever sure;
His truth at all times firmly stood,
And shall from age to age endure.

Praise God from whom
All blessings flow.
Praise Him
All creatures here below.
Praise Him above
Ye heav'nly host.
Praise Father, Son,
And Holy Ghost.
