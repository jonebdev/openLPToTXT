Holy, holy, holy Lord, God of hosts
Heav'n and earth are full of Thee;
Heav'n and earth are praising Thee,
O Lord, Most High.

Day is dying in the west
Heav'n is touching earth with rest;
Wait and worship while the night
Sets her ev'ning lamps alight,
Thro' all the sky.

Lord of life, beneath the dome,
Of the universe Thy home;
Gather us who seek Thy face,
To the fold of Thy embrace
For Thou art nigh.

While the deep'ning shadows fall
Heart of love enfolding all,
Thro' the glory and the grace
Of the stars that veil Thy face;
Our hearts ascend.

When forever from our sight,
Pass the stars the day;
The night Lord of angels,
On our eyes let eternal morning rise,
And shadows end.
