You want to be real,
You want to be empty inside,
You want to be someone laying down your pride,
You want to be someone someday,
Then Lay it all Down before the King.

You want to be whole,
You want to have purpose inside,
You want to have virtue and purify your mind
You want to be set free today then lay it all down before the king.

This is my Desire,
This is my Return,
This is my Desire,
To be Used by You.

You want to be Real,
You want to be emptied inside,
And I know my heart is to feel you near,
And I know my life is to do your will.

It's to do your will,
It's to do your will,

All my life I have seen where you've taken me,
Beyond all I have hoped and there's more left unseen,
There's not much I can do to repay all you've done,
So I give my hands to Use.
