O Lord,my God,when I in awesome wonder consider all the worlds thy hands have made,I see the stars,I hear the rolling thunder,thy power throughout the universe displayed

Then sings my soul,my savior God, to thy;how great thou art, how great thou art!Then sings my soul my savior God to be;how great thou art how great thou art. 
When through the woods and forest glades I wanderand hear the birds sing sweetly in trees;when I look down from lofty mountain grandeur and hear the brook,and feel the gentle breeze;

And when I think that God, his Son not sparing,sent him to die, I scarce can take it in; that on the cross, my burden gladly bearing,he bled and died, to take away my sin;

When Christ shall come with shout of acclamation and take me home, what joy shall fill my heart.Then I shall bow in humble adoration,and there proclaim,my God, how great thou art!
