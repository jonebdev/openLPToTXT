Love unfailing, overtaking my heart
You take me in
finding peace again, fear is lost in all you are

I would give the world to tell your story
Cause I know that you've called me
I know that you've called me
I've lost myself for good within your promise
And I won't hide it, I won't hide it

Jesus I believe in you and I would go
To the ends of the earth,
To the ends of the earth, for you
Alone are the son of God and all the world will see
That you are God, You are God.
