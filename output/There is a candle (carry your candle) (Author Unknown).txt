There is a candle in every soul
Some brightly burning some dark and cold
There is a spirit who brings the fire
Ignites a candle and makes his home

Carry your candle run to the darkness
Seek out the hopeless confused and torn
Hold out your candle for all to see it
Take your candle and go light your world

Frustrated brother see how he's tried to
Light his own candle some other way
See now our sister she's been robbed and lied to
And still holds a candle without a flame

Carry your candle run to the darkness
Seek out the lonely the tired and worn
Hold out your candle for all to see it
Take your candle and go light your world

We are a family whose hearts are blazing
We raise our candles and light up the sky
Praying to our father in the name of Jesus
Make us a beacon in darkest hours

Carry your candle run to the darkness
Seek out the helpless deceived and poor
Hold out your candle for all to see it
Take your candle and go light your world
Take your candle and go light your world
