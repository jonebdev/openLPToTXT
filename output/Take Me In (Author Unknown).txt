Take me passed the outer courts
and through the Holy Place
Passed the brazen alter, Lord I want to see Your face
Pass me by the crowds of people
The priests who sing Your praise
I hunger and thirst for Your righteousness
And it's only found one place

So take me in to the Holy of Holies
Take me in by the Blood of the Lamb
Take me in to the Holy of Holies
Take the coal, cleanse my lips, here I am
