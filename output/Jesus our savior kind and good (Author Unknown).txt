Jesus our savior kind and good
was born in a manger of staw and woods
and the friendly beasts around him stood
Jesus our savior kind and good

"I" said the donkey shaggy and rown
"I carried His mother up hill and down
I carried her safely to Bethlehem town"
"I" said the doneky shaggy and brown

"I" said the bow all white and red
"I gave Him my manger for a bed
I gave Him my hay to pillow His head
"I" said the cow all white and red

"I" said the sheed with the curly horn
"I gave Him my wool for a blanket warm
And he wore my coat on that Christmas morn
"I" said the sheep with the curly horn

"I" said the dove from the rafters high
"I cooed Him to sleep so He would not cry
We cooed Him to sleep my mate and I
"I" said the dove form my rafters high
