Alleluia! Alleluia!
Hearts to heaven and voices raise;
Sing to God a hymn of gladness,
Sing to God a hymn of praise.
He who on the cross as Savior,
For the world's salvation bled;
Jesus Christ, the King of Glory,
Now is risen from the dead.

Now the iron bars are broken,
Christ from death to life is born,
Glorious life, and life immortal,
On this resurrection morn;
Christ has triumphed, and we conquer
By His mighty enterprise;
We with Him to life eternal,
By His resurrection rise.
