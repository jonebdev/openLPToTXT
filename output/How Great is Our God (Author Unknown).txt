The splendor of a King, clothed in majesty,
Let all the earth rejoice, all the earth rejoice,
he wraps himself in light,
and darkness tries to hide
and trembles at his voice, trembles at his voice

How Great is our God, sing with me,
How great is our God, all will see
How great, how great is our God

Age to age he stands, and time is in his hands,
beginning and the end, beginning and the end.
The godhead, three in one: father, spirit, and son
The lion and the lamb, the lion and the lamb

Name above all Names
Worthy of all Praise
and My heart will sing
How Great Is Our God
