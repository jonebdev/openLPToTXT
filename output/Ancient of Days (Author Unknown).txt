Blessing and honor, glory and power
be unto the Ancient of Days;
From ev'ry nation, all of creation
Bow before the Ancient of Days

Ev'ry tongue in Heaven and earth
shall declare Your glory,
ev'ry knee will bow at your throne
in wor-ship
you will be exalted, O God,
and your Kingdom shall not pass away
O Ancient of Days

Your Kingdom shall reign over all the earth,
sing unto the Ancient of Days
For none can compare to Your matchless worth,
sing unto the Ancient of Days

O Ancient of Days. O Ancient of Days.
