There's a cry inmy heart
For your glory to fall
For your Presence to fill up senses

There is a yearning again
A thirst for discipline
A hunger for things that are deeper

Could You take me beyond
Could You carry me through
If I open my heart
Could I go there with you

For what do i have
If i dont have you Jesus
What in this life
Could mean any more
You are my rock
You are my glory
You are the lifter of my head

Could You take me beyond
Could You Carry me through
If i open my heart
Could i go there with you
For I've been here before
Yet i know there's still more
Olord i need to know You
