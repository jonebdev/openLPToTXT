A thousand times I've failed still your mercy remains, should I stumble again still I'm caught in your grace

Everlasting your light will shine when all else fades never ending your glory goes beyond all fame

And the cry of my heart is to bring you praise from the inside out Lord my soul cries out

Your will above all else still my purpose remains the art of losing myself in bringing you praise

In my heart and my soul Lord I give you control consume me from the inside out

Lord let justice and praise become my embrace to love you from the inside out
