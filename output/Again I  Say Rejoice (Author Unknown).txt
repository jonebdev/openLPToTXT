Rejoice in the Lord Always
And I again I say and again I say
Rejoice in the lord always,
And again I say and again I say rejoice,

Come bless the Lord
Come bless the Lord
Draw near to worship Christ the Lord,
And Bless his name, his holy name,
Declaring he is good,

O that men would praise him,
O that men would praise him,

O that men would praise his name,
Praise his name to the ends of the earth,
O that men would praise his name,
Praise his name to the ends of the earth,

And again I say and I again I say,
Again I say, Again I say, Again I say, Again I say,
Rejoice!
Rejoice- Rejoice,
Rejoice, Rejoice
