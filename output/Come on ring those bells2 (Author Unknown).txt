Everybody likes to take a holiday,
everybody likes to take a rest
Spending time together with the family
Sharing lots of love and happiness.

Come on ring those bells, light the Christmas tree,
Jesus is the King, born for you and me.
Come on ring those bells, everybody say,
Jesus, we remember it's Your birthday

Celebrations come because of something good.
Celebrations we love to recall
Mary had a baby boy in Bethlehem
The greatest celebration of them all.
