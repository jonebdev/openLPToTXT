Found love beyond all reason
You gave your life, your all for me
And called me your forever
Caught in the mercy fall out
I found hope, found life, found all I need
You're all I need

The time has come
To stand for all we believe in
So I for one
Am gonna give my praise to you (Jesus)

Today, Today it's all or nothing
All the way the praise goes out to you
Yeah, the praise goes out to you
Today, Today I live for one thing
To give you praise and everything I do
Yeah, all the praise goes out to you

All we are is yours
And all we're living for
Is all you are
Is all that you are
Lord
