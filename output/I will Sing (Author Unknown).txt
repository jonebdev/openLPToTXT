For you have set me free
You're all that I seek
Your love completes my life
You're the air that I breathe

And the savior of the world
Is the reason I live
And I will sing, I will sing

And I will lift my voice
to the one who has saved me
I will sing, I will sing.

And I'll cry out for more
Saying Lord, I need you
I will reach out
I'm reaching for more of you in my heart

And I will wait on you in the stillness lord
listen for your voice, pure as gold refined
In your presence lord here is where I belong
