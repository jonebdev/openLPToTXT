Hungry I come to you for I know you satisfy I am empty but I know your love does not run dry

So I wait for you, so I wait for you

I'm falling on my knees, offering all of me Jesus you're all my heart is living for

Broken I run to you for your arms are open wide I am weary but I know your touch restores my life
