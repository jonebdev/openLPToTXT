When I think about the Lord
How he saved me, how he raised me
How he filled me up with the holy ghost
How he healed me to the uttermost

When i think about the Lord
How he picked me up and turned me around
And set my feet on soild ground

It makes me wanna shout Hallelujah
Thank you, Jesus
Lord You're worthy of all the glory
All the honor
All the praise
It makes me wanna shout Hallelujah
Thank You Jesus
Lord You're worthy of all the glory
All the honor
All the praise
