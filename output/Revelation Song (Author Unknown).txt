Worthy is the, Lamb who was slain.
Holy, holy is he
Sing a new song to Him who sits on Heaven's Mercy Seat.

Holy, Holy Holy is the Lord, God Almighty.
Who was and is and is to come.
With all creation I sing, "Priase to the King of Kings"
You are my everything. And I will adore you

Clothed in rainbows, of living color.
Flashes of lightening, rolls of thunder.
Blessing and Honor. strength and glory and power be
To you, the only wise king.

Filled with wonder, awestruck wonder,
at the mention of your name.
Jesus, Your name is power,
breath and living water.
Such a marvelous mystery.
