Father true and merciful,
Bound to me with Love,
Adopted in, free from all sin,

Jesus savior glorified,
Your offering none could give,
I stand before you humbled and in awe,

And all to you God,
for all You are to me..

There is nothing like,
There is nothing like....
Your Love, Your Love,

Holy Spirit gift of God,
Teach my Soul to soar
Train me in Your Holy ways oh Lord..

I'll love you forever
I'll love you forever,
I'll love you forever, Lord...
