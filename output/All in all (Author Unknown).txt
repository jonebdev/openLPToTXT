You are my strength when I am weak you are the treasure that I seek...you are my all in all

Seeking you as a precious jewel Lord to give up I'd be a fool you are my all in all

Jesus lamb of God worthy is your name

Taking my sin my cross my shame, rising again I bless your name...you are my all in all

When I fall down you pick me up when I am dry you fill my cup..you are my all in all
