Standing here in Your presence
Thinking of the good things You have done
Waiting here patiently
Just to hear Your still small voice again

Holy righteous
Faithful 'til the end
Saviour healer
Redeemer and Friend

I will worship You for who You are 3X
Jesus

My soul secure
Your promise sure
Your love endures
Always
