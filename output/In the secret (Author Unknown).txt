In the secret in the quiet place in the stillness you are there

In the secret in the quiet hour I wait only for you cause I want to know you more

I want to know you, I want to hear your voice I want to know you more

I want to touch you, I want to see your face, I want to know you more

I am reaching for the highest goal that I might receive the prize

Pressing onward pushing every hindrance aside out of my way cause I want to know you more
