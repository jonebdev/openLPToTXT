And I'm so happy, so very happy,
I've got the love of Jesus in my heart,
And I'm so happy, so very happy,
I've got the love of Jesus in my heart.

I've got the joy, joy, joy, joy,
Down in my heart, down in my heart,
Down in my heart.
I've got the joy, joy, joy, joy,
Down in my heart,
Down in my heart to stay.

I have the peace
That passeth understanding
Down in my heart, down in my heart,
Down in my heart.
I have the peace
That passeth understanding
Down in my heart,
Down in my heart to stay.

I have the love of Jesus,
Love of Jesus, down in my heart,
Down in my heart, down in my heart.
I have the love of Jesus,
Love of Jesus, down in my heart,
Down in my heart to stay.

I've got the wonderful love,
Of my blessed Redeemer,
Way down in the depths of my heart,
Way down in the depths of my heart.
Way down in the depths of my heart.
I've got the wonderful love,
Of my blessed Redeemer,
Way down in the depths of my heart,
Way down in the depths of my heart to stay.

For there is therefore now no condemnation,
Down in my heart,
Down in my heart, down in my heart,
For there is therefore now no condemnation,
Down in my heart,
Down in my heart today.
