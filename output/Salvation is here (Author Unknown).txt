God above all the world in motion
God above all my hopes and fears
And I don't care what the world throws at me now
I'm gonna be alright

Hear the sound of the generations
Making loud their freedom song
All in all, that the world would know Your Name
We're gonna be alright

'Cause I know my God saved the day
And I know his Word never fails
And I know my God made a way for me
Salvation is here

Salvation is here
Salvation is here and he lives in me
Salvation is here
Salvation that died just to set me free
Salvation is here
Salvation is here and he lives in me
Salvation is here
'Cause You are alive and You live in me
Salvation is here
Salvation is here and he lives in me
Salvation is here
'Cause you are alive and you live in me
