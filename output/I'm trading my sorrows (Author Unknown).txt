I'm trading my sorrows, I'm trading my pain, I'm laying them down for the joy of the Lord

I'm trading my sickness I'm trading my shame I'm laying them down for the joy of the Lord

Yes Lord, yes Lord, yes, yes Lord(3x)
Amen

I am pressed but not crushed, persecuted not abandoned struck down but not destroyed

I am blessed beyond the curse for his promise will endure His joy's gonna be my strength

Though my sorrows may last for one night...joy comes in the morning!
