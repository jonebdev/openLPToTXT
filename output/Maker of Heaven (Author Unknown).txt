Keep my heart amazed,
let me see Your wonders everyday
Teach me in Your ways,
so that i may fear

You are walking on water,
You are calling me after
You are standing beside me now

You are the maker of Heaven
you turn my world around
You're making all things new again
Through it all I know You are God alone

Set my heart on fire,
let me burn with passion for your name
Take overmy life,
I surrender now

Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah,
You are God Alone
Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah,
You are God alone
