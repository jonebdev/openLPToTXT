For God so loved the world,
That He gave His only begotten Son,
That whosoever believeth in Him,
Whosoever believeth in Him,
Should not perish should not perish,
But have everlasting life.

A story sweet and wondrous,
Like heavenly music swells.
In chimings clear to all who will hear,
Ring out the gospel bells.

When, grieving brokenhearted,
Because of sin and shame,
We find a joy earth cannot destroy,
Believing on His name.

This love, beyond all measure,
Of earth or sea or sky,
Could only show its full overflow,
When Jesus came to die.

Come, brother come to Jesus,
His word was meant for you;
His grace receive, His promise believe,
And sing His praise anew.
