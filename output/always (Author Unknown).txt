Did You rise the sun for me?
Or paint a Million stars that I might
Know your majesty

Is your voice upon the wind
Is Everything I know marked with my
Maker's fingerprints

Breathe on me
Let me see Your face
Ever I will seek You

Cause all you are is all I want
Always,
Draw me close
In your arms
Oh God
I wanna be with you.

Can I feel you in the rain?
Abandon all I am to have you
Capture me again

Let the earth resound with praise
Can you hear as all creation lives to
Glorify one name

I wanna be with you,
I wanna be with you,
Oh God,
I wanna be with you
