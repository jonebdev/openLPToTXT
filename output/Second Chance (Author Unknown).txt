You called my name, reached out your hand
Restored my life, and I was redeemed
The moment you entered my life

Amazing grace, Christ gave that day
My life was changed when from my shoulders
Fell the weight of my sin

So it's with everything I am
I reach out for your hand
The hope for change
The second chance I've gained

On you I throw my life
Casting all my fears aside
Hoe could greater love than this
Ever possibly exist

Consume my thoughts
As I rest in You
I'm now in love with a Saviour
Bearing the marks of His love

So I'll wait upon you now
With my hands released to You
Where a little faith's enough
To see mountains lift and move
And I'll wait upon you now
Dedicated to Your will
A love that never fails
