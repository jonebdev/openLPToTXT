These are the days of Elijah
declaring the word of the Lord
And these are the days of Your servant, Moses,
Righteousness being restored.

And Though these are days of great trials,
of famine and darkness and sword
Still, we are the voice in the desert crying,
"Prepare ye the way of the Lord!"

Behold He comes, riding on the cloud
Shining like the sun, at the trumpet call
So lift your voice, it's the year of jubilee,
And out of Zion's hill, salvation comes.

And these are the daus pf Ezekiel,
The dry bones becoming as flesh.
And these are the days of Your servant, David,
Rebuilding the temple of praise.

And these are the days of the harvest,
The fields are as white in the world.
And we are the laborers in Your vineyard,
declaring the word of the Lord!

There's no one like Jehovah (4x)
