Glory, glory, hallelujah!
Glory, glory, hallelujah!
Glory, glory, hallelujah!
His truth is marching on.

Glory, glory, hallelujah.
Glory, glory, hallelujah.
Glory, glory, hallelujah.
Our God is marching on.

Mine eyes have seen the glory
Of the coming of the Lord;
He is trampling out the vintage
Where the grapes of wrath are stored;
He hath loosed the fateful lightning
Of His terrible swift sword;
His truth is marching on.

I have seen Him in the watchfires
Of a hundred circling camps;
They have builded Him an altar
In the evening dews and damps;
I can read His righteous sentence
By the dim and flaring lamps;
His day is marching on.

He has sounded forth the trumpet
That shall never sound retreat;
He is sifting out the hearts of men
Before His judgment seat;
O be swift, my soul, to answer Him!
Be jubilant, my feet!
Our God is marching on.

In the beauty of the lilies,
Christ was born across the sea,
With a glory in His bosom
That transfigures you and me;
As He died to make men holy,
Let us live to make men free,
While God is marching on.

Mine eyes have seen the glory
Of the coming of the Lord;
It is flowing through the cities
And the waste will be restored;
By the leading of the Spirit
And their trusting in His Word,
His army marches on.

Arise and shine my people,
See the glory of the Lord;
As the church with signs and wonders
Marches on in one accord;
His soldiers do not falter
As for Him they wield the sword,
His army marches on.

O join this mighty army
There's a battle to be won;
Let us now put in sickle
For the harvest time has come;
Countless multitudes are waiting
Just to hear of God's own Son,
His army marches on.
