Take these hands and lift them up
For I have not the strength to praise you near enough
For I have nothing
I have nothing without You

So take my voice and pour it out
Let it sing the songs of mercy I have found
For I have nothing
I have nothing without You

And all my soul needs
Is all your love to cover me
So all the world will see
That I have nothing
Without You

Take my body and build it up
May it be broken as an offering of love
For I have nothing
I have nothing without you

That I love you
With all my heart
With all my soul
With all my mind
All the strength that I can find

Take my time here on the earth
And let it glorify all that You are worth
For I am nothing without you
