Come, Holy Ghost, our hearts inspire;
Let us Thine influence prove:
Source of the old prophetic fire,
Fountain of life and love.

Come, Holy Ghost for moved by Thee
The prophets wrote and spoke.
Unlock the truth, Thyself the key;
Unseal the Sacred Book.

God, through Himself, we then shall know
If Thou within us shine,
And sound with all Thy saints below,
The depths of love divine.
