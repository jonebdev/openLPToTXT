I Search for You, God of Strength
I bow to You, in brokeness.

No other King could have so humbly come,
To save my soul and heal my heart.

I have nothing more, than all You offer me.
There is nothing else, thats of worth to me.

I love you Lord, You rescued me.
You are all that I want, Your all that I need.

I pray to You, God of peace.
I rest in You, my cares released.

In Your freedom, I will live, In Your freedom I will live
I offer devotion, I offer devotion.
