And crown Him crown Him,
Crown Him crown Him,
And crown Him Lord of all.

All hail the pow'r of Jesus' name,
Let angels prostrate fall,
Let angels prostrate fall,
Bring forth the royal diadem.

Ye chosen seed of Israel's race,
Ye ransomed from the fall,
Ye ransomed from the fall,
Hail Him who saves you by His grace.

Let every kindred ev'ry tribe,
On this terrestrial ball,
On this terrestrial ball,
To Him all majesty ascribe.

O that with yonder sacred throng,
We at His feet may fall,
We at His feet may fall,
We'll join the everlasting song.
