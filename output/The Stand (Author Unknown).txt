You stood before creation
eternity in Your hand
You spoke the earth into motion
My soul now to stand

Youstood before my failure
And carried cross for my shame
My sin weighed upon Your shoulders
My soul now to stand

So what can I say
And what can I do
But offer this heart O God
Comletely to You

So I'll walk upon salvation
Your Spirit alive in me
This life to declare Your promise
My soul now to stand

So I'll stand
With arms high and heart abandoned
In awe of the One who gave it all
I'll stand
My soul Lord to You surrendered
All I am is Yours

So what can I say
And what can I do
But offer this heart O God
Completely to You
