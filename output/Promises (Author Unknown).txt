All of Your promises won't let go of me

I surrendered my life to Your ways
I have learned what it means to obey
Jesus, my heart has been changed by You

I am walking the path You have made
I am seeking the truth everyday
Jesus, my heart has been changed by You

I couldn't walk away if I tried
Cause Your love is better than life

Now, the sun's shining bright and it just won't set
Cause Your love is alive and it lights my step
My heart is amazed everyday to the next
Your joy overtakes and I can't forget about it

Oh Oh Oh( 3x) I can't forget about it

All of Your Promises won't let go of me (4X)
