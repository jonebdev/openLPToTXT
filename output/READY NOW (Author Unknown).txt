COME LIKE YOU PROMISED YOU WOULD
I WANT TO SURRENDER FOR GOOD
I KNOW THAT I NEED YOU
AD I DON'T WANT TO KEEP LIVING LIFE ALONE

SO TAKE MY HEART
AND MAKE IT NEW
AND MAKE IT TRUE
AND MAKE IT LIKE YOU

TAKE MY HANDS
I LIFT THEM HIGH
THEY'RE YOURS NOT MINE TO DO
DO WHAT YOU WILL, DO WHAT YOU WILL,
DO WHAT YOU WILL.

I FEEL LIKE A BLIND MAN IN YOUR SIGHT
I KNOW THAT I'M WICKED IN YOUR EYES
SO WASH ME AND MAKE ME SHINE LIKE YOUR SON
I WANT TO TELL EVERYONE THAT YOU'RE THE ONLY ONE

I'M READY NOW, I'M READY NOW,
I'M READY NOW, DO WHAT YOU WILL.
