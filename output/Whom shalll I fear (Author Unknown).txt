I will seek you oh Lord, while I am in my youth
and I will trust you oh Lord, and I'll proclaim your truth.
For you searched and found me, while I was far away,
In my troubled times, You always keep me safe.

Oh.....Oh.....Oh.....Oh
Oh......Oh....Oh....Oh..

The Lord is my light and my salvation,
Whom Shall I fear? Whom Shall I fear?
The Lord is the stronghold of my life,
Whom Shall I fear? Whom shall I fear?
