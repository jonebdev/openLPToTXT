form the highest of heights to the depths of the sea
creation revealing your majesty
from the colors of fall to the fragrance of spring
every creature unique in the songs that it sings all exclaiming

idescribable uncontainable
you place the stars in the sky and you know them by name
you are amazing God

all powerful untameable
awestruck we fall to your knees as we humbly proclaim
your are amazing God

who has told every lightning bolt where it should go
or seen heavenly storehouses laden with snow
Who imagined the sun and gives source to it's light
yet conceals to bring us coolness of night, none can fathom
