As discussed last week,
God has a purpose for every
single situation that you go
through in your life.

It is up to you whether you
want to trust God through your
difficulties or to turn your back and run.

Have you ever been put in a situation where God was pressing for you to do something but you were overcome with fear? Embarressment? Anxiousness? Did you overcome your fear and complete what you felt God wanted you to do or did you ignore God's calling?

Maybe God wants to use you to reach that coworker down the hall.
Maybe it's that friend you would rather get a drink with then speak to about God's grace.
Maybe it's your mother or father who need to hear your testimony, but you're afraid they'll be disappointed.

Even though sometimes it is easier to run, think about why you feel God is leading you to do that thing that he wants you to do. He may want to bless you through the situation, but a lot of the times we don't allow him to. Whether or not you muster up the courage to follow God's calling, his will will be completed whether through you or not.

Please read:

Luke 22:42

Esther 4:12-16

Jeremiah 29:10-15

1. Think about a time in your life that you know God appointed you "for such a time" as that.

2. Why do you think that God chooses certain people to accomplish certain things when he is all powerful and can get that thing done by himself? Or use an animal to get it done (Numbers 22: 21-35).

3. Think of a time where you did follow God's lead. How did you feel during and after?
