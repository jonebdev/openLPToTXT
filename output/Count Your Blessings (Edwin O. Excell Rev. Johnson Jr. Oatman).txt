Count your blessings
Name them one by one.
Count your blessings
See what God hath done.
Count your blessings
Name them one by one.
Count your many blessings
See what God hath done.

When upon life's billows
You are tempest tossed,
When you are discouraged
Thinking all is lost,
Count your many blessings
Name them one by one,
And it will surprise you
What the Lord hath done.

Are you ever burdened
With a load of care,
Does the cross seem heavy
You are called to bear.
Count your many blessings
Every doubt will fly,
And you will be singing
As the days go by.

When you look at others
With their lands and gold,
Think that Christ has promised
You His wealth untold.
Count your many blessings
Money cannot buy,
Your reward in heaven
Nor your home on high.

So amid the conflict
Whether great or small,
Do not be discouraged
God is over all.
Count your many blessings
Angels will attend,
Help and comfort give you
To your journey's end.
