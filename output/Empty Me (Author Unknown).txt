Holy fire burn away,
My desire of anything,
That is not of you and is of me,
I want more of you and less of me,

Empty me, Empty Me,
And fill, won't you fill me,
With you, with you,
Oh Empty me now.

Oh Won't you empty me, Oh Won't you emtpy me now,
Oh Won't you empty me, Oh Won't you emtpy me now,
I want more, I want more, I want more
Of you Jesus.
I want more, I want more. Ohhhh..

Thank you Jesus, Thank you Jesus,
Thank You Jesus, Holy Fire, Holy Fire.
