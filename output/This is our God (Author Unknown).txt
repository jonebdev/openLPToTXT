Your grace is enough
More than I need
At your word I will believe
I wait for you
Draw near again
Let your spirit make me new

I will fall at your feet
I will fall at your feet
And I will worship You here

Your presence in me
Jesus light the way
By the power of Your word
I am restored
Iam redeemed
By Your spirit I am free

Freely You gave it all for us
Surrendered Your life upon that cross
Great is the love
Poured out for all
This is our God
Lifted on high from death to life
Forever our God is glorified
Servant and King
Rescued the word
This is our God
