You broke the night like the sun
And healed my Heart with your great Love
Any trouble I couldn't bear
You lifted me upon your shoulders

Love thats stronger
Love that covers sin
and takes the weight of the world

I love you
All of my hope is in You
Jesus Christ take my life take all of me

You stand upon mountain tops with me
With you I walk through the valleys
You gave your only Son for me
Your grace is all I rely on

I love You so, And I give up my heart to say
I need you so, My everything
Oh Lord
