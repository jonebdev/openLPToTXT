I WON'T BE SATISFIED
I WON'T B FOUND ALRIGHT
TILL I FIND
WHO YOU ARE

I CLIMB EVERY MOUNTAIN
I TRAVELEDTHE DEEPEST VALLEY
TO FIND
WHO YOU ARE

YOU, YOU CAUSE THE LAME TO WALK
YOU OPEN LIPS TO TALK
YOU'RE EVERYTHING
AND THAT IS WHO YOU ARE

YOU, YOU CALM THE STORM AT NIGHT
YOU TURN THE DARK TO LIGHT
YOU'RE EVERYTHING
AND THAT IS WHO YOU ARE

MY SAVIOR, MY HEALER, REDEEMER
THAT IS WHO YOU ARE
CREATOR, MY MAKER, MY FATHER
THAT IS WHO YOU ARE
