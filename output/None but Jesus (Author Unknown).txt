In the quiet, in the stillness I know that you are God
In the secret of your presence I know there I am restored,
When you call I won't refuse
Each new day again I'll choose...

There is no one else for me,
None but Jesus,
Crucified to set me free,
Now I live to bring you Praise.

In the chaos, in confusion I know youre sovereign still
in the moment of my weakness
You give me grace to do your will

When you call I wont delay
This my song through all my days..

All my delight is in you Lord
All of my hope,
All of my strength..
All my delight is in you Lord,
Forever more.
