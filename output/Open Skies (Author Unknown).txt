Praise Him under open skies
Everthing breathing praising God
In the company, of all who love the King

I will dance, I will sing
It could be heavenly
Turn the music loud, lift my voice and shout
From where I am
From where I've been
He's been there with me
He's built a monument

His very people
So let his people
Sing, sing, sing

And its so wonderful
Just to be here now

Praise Him under open skies
Everthing breathing prasing God
In the company of all who love the King

Praise him under open skies
Everthing breathing praisin God
In the company , of all who love the King
Let us dance, Let us sing
it could be heavenly
Turn the music loud and sing

Lift your voice to Heaven
Lift your head and sing
to the one who gave His love
This is our offering
Lift your voice to heaven
Lift your Head and sing
to the One who gave His son
here our lives we bring
