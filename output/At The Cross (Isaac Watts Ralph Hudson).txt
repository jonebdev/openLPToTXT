At the cross, at the cross,
Where I first saw the light
And the burden of my heart rolled away;
It was there by faith, I received my sight
And now I am happy all the day!

Alas and did my Savior bleed,
And did my sov'reign die?
Would He devote that sacred head,
For such a worm as I?

Was it for crimes that I have done,
He groaned upon the tree?
Amazing pity grace unknown,
And love beyond degree!

Well might the sun in darkness hide,
And shut His glories in;
When Christ the mighty Maker died,
For man the creature's sin.

But drops of grief can ne'er repay,
The debt of love I owe;
Here, Lord, I give myself to Thee,
'Tis all that I can do!

Thus might I hide my blushing face
While Calvary's cross appears,
Dissolve my heart in thankfulness,
And melt mine eyes to tears.
