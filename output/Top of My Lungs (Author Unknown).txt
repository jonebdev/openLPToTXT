Words of worship, rise like a river within me
And thoughts to express are so many
Wanna bless You God
Can't be silent, I think of the mercies You show me
My lips begin overflowing
Great is Your Love
Such Gratitude
for all that You do, Jesus to You

At the top of my lungs I will sing Hallelujah
You're the One who saved me, the One who gave me
This life I live, forevermore, forevermore
At the top of my lungs I will sing Hallelujah
I'm not ashamed, I'll praise Your name
Let the whole world know I love You Lord, I love You Lord

You are worthy, I join the song of creation
That rings out across every nation
Let my heart be heard
I need You so
I don't care who knows, from the depths of my soul
