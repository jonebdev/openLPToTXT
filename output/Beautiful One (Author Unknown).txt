Wonderful so wonderful
Is your unfailing love
Your cross has spoken mercy over me
No eye has seen no ear has heard
No heart could fully know
How Glorious, How Beautiful You are

Beautiful One I love you
Beautiful One I adore
Beautiful One my soul must sing

Powerful so Powerful
You're glory fills the skies
You're mighty works displayed for all to see
The beauty of your majesty
Awakes my heart to sing
How marvelous, How wonderful you are

You opened my eyes to your wonders anew
You captured my heart with this love
Because nothing on Earth is all beautiful as you

My soul my soul must sing
My soul my soul must sing
My soul my soul must sing
Beautiful One
