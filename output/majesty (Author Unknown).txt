Here I am
Humbled by your majesty,
Covered by your grace so I'm free
Here I am, Knowing im a sinful man,
Covered by the blood of the lamb

Now I've found,
The greatest love of all is mine
Since you laid down your life
the Greatest sacrifice,

Majesty, Majesty,
Your grace has found me just as I am
Empty handed but alive in your hand

Majesty, Majesty
forever I am changed by your love,
In the presence of your majesty..

Here I am, humbled by the love that you give,
Forgiven so that I can forgive,
Here I stand, knowing that I'm your desire
Sanctified by glory and fire.
