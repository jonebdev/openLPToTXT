When I think of all I've done
Nothing compares to what you give
And to drink of what you bring
You quench the thirst for me to live
I am satisfied by what
Tenderness you've shown to me
And I empty all that I am

And you fill my life
You're everything to me
There's nothing else I need anymore
And I know you're everything to me
And there's nothing else I need anymore

I have tasted and I know
This fire birthed inside will only grow
And I've sought all that this world
Tried to offer me
And it led me to your feet
And I empty all that I am

I will lay down all my needs
And you will come and make them new
To make you my only desire
My desire
