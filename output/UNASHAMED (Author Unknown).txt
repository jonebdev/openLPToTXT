I have not much to offer You
not mere what You deserve
but still I come because Your cross
has placed in me my worth

Oh Christ my King of sympathy
whose wounds secure my peace
Your grace extends to call me friend
Your mercy sets me free

And I know I'm weak
I know I'm unworthy
to call upon Your name
but because of grace
because of Your mercy
I stand here unashamed

I can't explain this kind of love
I'm humbled and amazed that You'd come down from heaven's heights
and greet me face to face

Here I am at Your feet in my brokeness complete
