There is Love that came for us
Humbled to a sinner's cross
You broke my shame and sinfulness
You rose again victorious

Faithfulness none can deny
through the storm and through the fire
there is truth that sets me free
Jesus Christ who lives in me

You are stronger, You are stronger
Sin is broken, You have saved me
It is written, Christ is risen
Jesus, You are Lord of all

No beginning and no end
You're my hope and defense
You came to seek and save the lost
You paid it all upon the cross

So let Your name be lifted
Be lifted higher
Be lifted higher
