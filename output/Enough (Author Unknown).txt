All of You, Is more than enough for
All of Me
For every thirst and need
You satisy me with Your love
and All I have in You
Is more than enough.

You are my supply
My breath of life
Still more awesome than I know
You are my reward
Worth living for
Still more awesome than I know

You're the sacrifice
Of greatest price
Still more awesome than I know
You're my coming king
You are everything
Still more awesome than I know

More than all I want
More than all I need
You are more than enough for me
More than all I know
More than all I can say
You are more than enough for me.
