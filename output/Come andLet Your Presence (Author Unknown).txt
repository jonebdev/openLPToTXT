Come and let your presence
Fill our praise, fill our praise
Come and let Your presence fill this place

You are the one we want to meet
Jesus shine though all the praises that we sing

We have come to give You
Highest praise, highest praise
We have come to love You in this place

Its all for you
Here we are, here we are

So open up heaven
open up heaven
