Begin my tongue some heav'nly theme
And speak some boundless thing;
The mighty works or mightier name,
Of our eternal King.

Tell of His wondrous faithfulness
And sound His pow'r abroad;
Sing the sweet promise of His grace,
The love and truth of God.

His very word of grace is strong,
As that which built the skies;
The voice that roles the stars along,
Speaks all the promises.

O might I hear Thy heav'nly tongue,
But whisper Thou art mine;
Those gentle words shall raise my song,
To notes almost divine.
