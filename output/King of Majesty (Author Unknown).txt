YOU KNOW THAT I LOVE YOU
YOU KNOW THAT I WANT TO
KNOW YOU SO MUCH MORE
MORE THAN I HAVE BEFORE

THESE WORDS ARE FROM MY HEART
THESE WORDS ARE NOT MADE UP
AND I WILL LIVE FOR YOU
I AM DEVOTED TO YOU

KING OF MAJESTY
I HAVE ONE DESIRE
JUST TO BE WITH YOU MY LORD
JUST TO BE WITH YOU MY GOD

JESUS YOU ARE THE SAVIOR OF MY SOUL
AND FOREVER AND EVER I'LL GIVE MY PRAISES TO YOU
