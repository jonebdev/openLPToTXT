In my heart, In my heart
There's a fire burning
A passion deep within my soul
Not slowing down, not growing cold

An unquenchable flame that keeps burning brighter
A love that's blazing like the sun
For who you are and what you've done.

And as the fire is raging on
So your priase becomes my song

The whole earth is filled with your glory Lord
Angels and men adore,
Creation longs for what's in store

May you be honored and glorified
Exalted and lifted high
Here at Your feet I lay my life.

From the ends of the earth
To the heights of heaven
Your glory Lord is far and wide
Through history you reign on high

From the depths of the sea
To the mountain's summit
Your power Lord it knows no bounds
A higher love cannot be found

So let the universe proclaim
Your great power, and Your great name
