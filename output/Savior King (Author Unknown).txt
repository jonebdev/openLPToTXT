Let now the weak say "I have strength"
By the spirit of power
that raised Christ from the dead
let now the poor stand and confess
that my portion is Him
and I'm more than blessed

Let now our hearts burn with a flame
A fire consuming all for Your Son's holy name
And with the heavens we declare, You are our King

We love You Lord
We worship You
You are our God
You alone are good

Let now Your church shine as the bride
That You saw in your heart
As You offered up your life
Let now the lost be welcome home
By the saved and redeemed
Those adopted as Your own

You asked Your Son to carry this
the heavy cross, our weight of sin

I love You Lord I worship You
Hope which was lost
Now stands renewed

I give my life to honor this
the love of Christ
The Savior King
