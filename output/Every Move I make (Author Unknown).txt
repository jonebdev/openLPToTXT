Every move I make I make in you
You make me move, Jesus
Every breath I take I breathe in you

Every step I take I take in You
You are my way Jesus
Every breath I take I breathe in you

Waves of mercy, Waves of Grace
Everywhere I look, I see Your face
Your love has captured me
Oh my God this Love, how can it be?
