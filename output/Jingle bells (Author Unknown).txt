Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way!
Oh what fun it is to ride, In a one-horse open sleigh,
Hey!

Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way!
Oh what fun it is to ride,
In a one-horse open sleigh!

Dashing through the snow... In a one-horse open sleigh
O'er the fields we go... Laughin' all the way!
Bells on bob-tail ring... Makin' spirits bright
What fun it is to ride an' sing,
A sleighing song tonight!

Oh! jingle bells, jingle bells, Jingle all the way!
Oh what fun it is to ride, In a one-horse open sleigh,
Hey!

Jingle bells, jingle bells, Jingle all the way!
Oh what fun it is to ride . . . In a one-horse open sleigh!
