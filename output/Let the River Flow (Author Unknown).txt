Let the lost man say,
"I am found in Him"
Let the poor man say,
"I am rich in Him"
Oh, let the river flow

Let the blind man say,
"I can see again"
Let the dead man say,
"I am born again"
Oh, let the river flow (2x)

Let the river flow, let the river flow
Holy Spirit come and move in power
Let the river flow (4x)
