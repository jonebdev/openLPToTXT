Let everything that, everything that
everything that has breath
praise the Lord

Praise You in the morning
Praise You in the evening
Praise You when I'm young and when I'm old

Praise You when I'm laughing
Praise You when I'm grieving
Praise You every season of the soul

If we could see how much Your worth
Your power, Your might, Your endless love
Then surely we would never cease to praise

Praise You in the heavens
Joining with the angels
Praising You forever and a day

Praise You on the earth now
joining with creation
Calling all the nations to Your praise

If they could see how much Your worth
Your power, Your might, Your endless love
Then surely they would never cease to praise
