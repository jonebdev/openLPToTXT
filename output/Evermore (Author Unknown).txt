Lost for words with all to say,
Lord You take my breath away,
Still my soul, my soul cries out,
You are Holy.

And as I look upon Your name,
Circumstances fade away
And now Your glory steals my heart,
You are Holy
You are Holy
You are Holy Lord.

Evermore my heart, my heart, will say
Above all
I live for Your glory
Even if my world falls I will say
Above all
I live for Your Glory
