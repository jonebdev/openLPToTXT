Lord the light of your love is shining
In the midst of the darkness shining.
Jesus, Light of the world, shine upon us
Set us free by the Truth you now bring us.
Shine on me, Shine on me.

Shine, Jesus, shine,
Fill this land with the Father's glory.
Blaze, Spirit, blaze,
Set our hearts on fire.
Flow, River, flow,
Flood the nations with grace and mercy
Send forth Your Word,
Lord and let there be light.

Lord, I come to your awesome presence
From the shadows into your radiance.
By the blood I may enter your brightness,
Search me, try me, consume all my darkness.
Shine on me, Shine on me.

As we gaze on your kingly brightness
So our faces display your likeness.
Ever changing from glory to glory
Mirrored here may our lives tell your story.
Shine on me, Shine on me.
