You thought of us before the world began to breathe
You knew our names before we came to be
you saw the very day we'd fall away from you
and how desperately we need to be redeemed

Lord Jesus, come lead us
We're desperate for your touch

Oh great and mighty One, with one desire we come
That you would reign, that you would reign in us
We're offering up our lives, a living sacrifice
that you would reign, that you would reign in us.

Spirit of the Living God, fall fresh again
Come search our hearts and purify our lives
We need your perfect love, we need your discipline
We're lost unless you guide us with your light.

We cry out for your life to revive us, cry out
For Your love to define us, cry out
For your merc to keep us blameless until you return

So reign, please reign in us
Come purify our hearts, we need your touch
Come cleanse us likea flood and send us out
So the world may know you reign, You reign in us.
