Children of the heavenly Father,
Safely in His bosom gather;
Nestling bird nor star in heaven
Such a refuge e'er was given.

God His own doth tend and nourish,
In His holy courts they flourish;
From all evil things He spares them,
In His mighty arms He bears them.

Neither life nor death shall ever,
From the Lord His children sever;
Unto them His grace He showeth,
And their sorrows all He knoweth.

Lo, their very hairs He numbers,
And no daily care encumbers;
Them that share His every blessing,
And His help in woes distressing.

Praise the Lord in joyful numbers,
Your protector never slumbers;
At the will of your defender,
Every foe man must surrender.

Though He giveth or He taketh,
God His children ne'er forsaketh;
His the loving purpose solely
To preserve them pure and holy.
