What to say, Lord
It's You who gave me life and I
Can't explain just how
Much you mean to me now
That you have saved me Lord
I give all that I am to you
That everyday I can
Be a light that shines Your Name

Everyday Lord I'll
Learn to stand upon your Word
And I pray that I
That I might come to know you more
That you would guide me in
In every single step I take
That everyday I can
Be Your light unto the world

Everyday, it's you I live for
Everyday, I'll follow after you
Everyday, I'll walk with you my Lord

It's you I live for Everyday
