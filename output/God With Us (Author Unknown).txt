Who are we That you would be mindful of us
What do You see thats worth looking your way
We are free in ways that we never should be
Sweet release from the grip of these chains

Like hinges straining from the weight
My heart no longer can keep from singing

All that is within me cries for You alone be glorified
Emmanuel God with us
My heart sings a brand new song the debt is paid these chains are gone
Emmanuel God with us

Lord you know our hearts don't deserve your glory still you show a love we cannot afford

Such a tiny offering compared to calvary nevertheless we lay it at your feet
