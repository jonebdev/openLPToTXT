Over the mountains and the sea your river runs with love for me and I will open my heart and let the Healer set me free

I'm happy to be in the truth and I will daily lift my hands for I will always sing of when your love came down

I could sing of your love forever, I could sing of your love forever

Oh, I feel like dancing it's foolishness I know, but when the world has seen the light they will dance with joy like we're dancing now
