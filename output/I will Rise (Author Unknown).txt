There's a peace I've come to know
though my heart and flesh may fail
There's an anchor for my soul,
I can say "it is well!"

Jesus has overcome and the grave is overwhelmed
The victory is won,
He has risen from the dead.

And I will rise when he calls my name
No more sorrow, no more pain,
I will rise on eagle's wings,
Before my God, fall on my knees
And rise, I will rise

There's a day that's drawing near,
When the darkness breaks to light,
And the shadows disappear
and my faith shall be my eyes

And I hear the voice of many angles sing
Worthy is the lamb
And I hear the cry of every longing heart
Worthy is the lamb.
