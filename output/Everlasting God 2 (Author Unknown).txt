One thing I know that I have found
Through all the troubles that surround
You are the Rock that never fails, you never fail.

One thing I know, that I believe
Through every blessing I receive
You are the only one that stays, You always stay

You never change, You're still the same
You are the everlasting God
You will remain after the day is gone
And the things of earth have passed
Everlasting God.
