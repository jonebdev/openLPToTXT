Turn your ear to heaven and hear the noise inside
The sond of angel's awe, the sound of angel's song

And all this for a King, we could join and sing
All to Christ our King

Oh praise Him, oh, praise Him
He is holy, He is Holy

Turn your gaze to heaven and raise a joyous noise
The sound of salvation come, the sound of rescued ones

All this for a king, angels join to sing
All for Christ our King

Alleluia, (4x)
Alleluia, alleluia, He is holy, He is holy
