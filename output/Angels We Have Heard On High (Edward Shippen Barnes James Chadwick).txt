Gloria, in excelsis Deo!
Gloria, in excelsis Deo!

Angels we have heard on high,
Sweetly singing o'er the plains;
And the mountains in reply,
Echoing their joyous strains.

Shepherds, why this jubilee?
Why your joyous strains prolong?
Say what may the tidings be;
Which inspire your heav'nly song?

Come to Bethlehem and see,
Him whose birth the angels sing;
Come adore on bended knee,
Christ the Lord, the newborn King.

See within a manger laid,
Jesus, Lord of heav'n and earth;
Mary, Joseph, lend your aid,
With us sing our Savior's birth.
