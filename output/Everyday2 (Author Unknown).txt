What to say Lord,
It's you who gave me life and I
Can't explain just how
Much you mean to me now that
You have saved me Lord
I give all that I am to You
that everyday I can
Be a light that shines your name

Everday Lord I'll
learn to stand upon your word
And I pray that I
That I might come to know you More
That you would guide me
In every single step I take
that everday I can
Be your light unto the world

Everyday
It's you I'll live for
Everyday
I'll follow after you
Everyday
I'll walk with you my Lord

It's you I live for everyday
It's you I live for everyday
It's you I live for everday
