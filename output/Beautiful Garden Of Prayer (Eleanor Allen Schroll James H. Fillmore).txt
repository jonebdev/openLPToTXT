O the beautiful garden, the garden of prayer,
O the beautiful garden of prayer.
There my Savior awaits, and He opens the gates
To the beautiful garden of prayer.

There's a garden where Jesus is waiting,
There's a place that is wondrously fair.
For it glows with the light of His presence,
'Tis the beautiful garden of prayer.

There's a garden where Jesus is waiting,
And I go with my burden and care.
Just to learn from His lips, words of comfort,
In the beautiful garden of prayer.

There's a garden where Jesus is waiting,
And He bids you to come meet Him there,
Just to bow and receive a new blessing,
In the beautiful garden of prayer.
