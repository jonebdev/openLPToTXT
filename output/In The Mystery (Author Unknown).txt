In Your Name, there is hope when all seems lost.
There is freedom in the power of the cross.
Let the world see

In Your Name, there is truth where logic fails
Understanding that makes sense of our days
You are worthy

Hear the sound of all creation roar
We're crying out as one for You are our God.
Now show us the way of Your love
And we will come running.

All for Jesus' Name, Your love displayed
We are alive in the mystery
All for sinners' gain, Your life You gave
We'll sing Your praise for eternity.

In Your Name, there is mercy without end
Overtaking us now time and again
Let the world see

In Your Name, there is love that never fails
And the promise that Your Word will prevail.
You are worthy.

Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Great is Your Name, Great is Your Name.
