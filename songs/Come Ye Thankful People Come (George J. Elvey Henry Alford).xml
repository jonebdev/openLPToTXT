    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Come, ye thankful people, come; newline Raise the song of harvest home. newline All is safely gathered in newline Ere the winter storms begin. newline God, our maker, doth provide newline For our wants to be supplied. newline Come to God's own temple, come; newline Raise the song of harvest home.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>All the world is God's own field, newline Fruit unto His praise to yield; newline Wheat and tares together sown, newline Unto joy or sorrow grown; newline First the blade and then the ear, newline Then the full corn shall appear. newline Lord of harvest grant that we newline Wholesome grain and pure may be.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>For the Lord our God shall come, newline And shall take His harvest home; newline From His field shall in that day newline All offenses purge away; newline Give His angels charge at last newline In the fire the tares to cast, newline But the fruitful ears to store newline In His garner evermore.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>Even so Lord, quickly come newline To Thy final harvest home; newline Gather Thou Thy people in, newline Free from sorrow, free from sin; newline There forever purified, newline In Thy presence to abide. newline Come with all Thine angels come; newline Raise the glorious harvest home.</lines>
