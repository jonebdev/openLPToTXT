    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Come, ye thankful people, come;<br/>Raise the song of harvest home.<br/>All is safely gathered in<br/>Ere the winter storms begin.<br/>God, our maker, doth provide<br/>For our wants to be supplied.<br/>Come to God's own temple, come;<br/>Raise the song of harvest home.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>All the world is God's own field,<br/>Fruit unto His praise to yield;<br/>Wheat and tares together sown,<br/>Unto joy or sorrow grown;<br/>First the blade and then the ear,<br/>Then the full corn shall appear.<br/>Lord of harvest grant that we<br/>Wholesome grain and pure may be.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>For the Lord our God shall come,<br/>And shall take His harvest home;<br/>From His field shall in that day<br/>All offenses purge away;<br/>Give His angels charge at last<br/>In the fire the tares to cast,<br/>But the fruitful ears to store<br/>In His garner evermore.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>Even so Lord, quickly come<br/>To Thy final harvest home;<br/>Gather Thou Thy people in,<br/>Free from sorrow, free from sin;<br/>There forever purified,<br/>In Thy presence to abide.<br/>Come with all Thine angels come;<br/>Raise the glorious harvest home.</lines>
    </verse>
