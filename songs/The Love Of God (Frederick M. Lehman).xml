    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>O love of God, how rich and pure! newline How measureless and strong! newline It shall forevermore endure, newline The saints' and angels' song.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>The love of God is greater far, newline Than tongue or pen can ever tell, newline It goes beyond the highest star newline And reaches to the lowest hell; newline The guilty pair, bowed down with care, newline God gave His Son to win; newline His erring child He reconciled newline And pardoned from his sin.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>When years of time shall pass away newline And earthly thrones and kingdoms fall, newline When men, who here refuse to pray, newline On rocks and hills and mountains call; newline God's love so sure shall still endure, newline All measureless and strong; newline Redeeming grace to Adam's race newline The saints' and angels' song.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>Could we with ink the ocean fill newline And were the skies of parchment made, newline Were ev'ry stalk on earth a quill newline And ev'ry man a scribe by trade. newline To write the love of God above newline Would drain the ocean dry; newline Nor could the scroll contain the whole newline Tho stretched from sky to sky.</lines>
