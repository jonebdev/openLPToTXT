    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>O love of God, how rich and pure!<br/>How measureless and strong!<br/>It shall forevermore endure,<br/>The saints' and angels' song.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>The love of God is greater far,<br/>Than tongue or pen can ever tell,<br/>It goes beyond the highest star<br/>And reaches to the lowest hell;<br/>The guilty pair, bowed down with care,<br/>God gave His Son to win;<br/>His erring child He reconciled<br/>And pardoned from his sin.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>When years of time shall pass away<br/>And earthly thrones and kingdoms fall,<br/>When men, who here refuse to pray,<br/>On rocks and hills and mountains call;<br/>God's love so sure shall still endure,<br/>All measureless and strong;<br/>Redeeming grace to Adam's race<br/>The saints' and angels' song.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>Could we with ink the ocean fill<br/>And were the skies of parchment made,<br/>Were ev'ry stalk on earth a quill<br/>And ev'ry man a scribe by trade.<br/>To write the love of God above<br/>Would drain the ocean dry;<br/>Nor could the scroll contain the whole<br/>Tho stretched from sky to sky.</lines>
