    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>The spacious firmament on high, newline With all the blue ethereal sky newline And spangled heav'ns a shining frame; newline Their great original proclaim. newline Th'unwearied sun from day to day, newline Does His Creator's pow'r display newline And publishes to every land, newline The work of an Almighty hand.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Soon as the evening shades prevail, newline The moon takes up the wondrous tale newline And nightly to the listening earth, newline Repeats the story of her birth; newline While all the stars that round her burn newline And all the planets in their turn newline Confirm the tidings as they roll, newline And spread the truth from pole to pole.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>What though in solemn silence all, newline Move round the dark terrestrial ball? newline What though no real voice nor sound, newline Amid their radiant orbs be found; newline In reason's ear they all rejoice newline And utter forth a glorious voice; newline Forever singing as they shine, newline The hand that made us is divine.</lines>
