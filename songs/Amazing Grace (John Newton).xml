    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Amazing grace how sweet the sound, newline That saved a wretch like me; newline I once was lost, but now am found newline Was blind, but now I see.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>T'was grace that taught my heart to fear, newline And grace my fears relieved; newline How precious did that grace appear newline The hour I first believed.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>Through many dangers, toil and snares, newline I have already come; newline 'Tis grace has brought me safe thus far, newline And grace will lead me home.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>When we've been there ten thousand years newline Bright shining as the sun, newline We've no less days to sing God's praise newline Than when we've first begun.</lines>
