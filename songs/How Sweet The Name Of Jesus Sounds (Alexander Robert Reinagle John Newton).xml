    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>How sweet the name of Jesus sounds, newline In a believer's ear; newline It soothes his sorrows, heals his wounds newline And drives away his fear.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>It makes the wounded Spirit whole newline And calms the troubled breast; newline 'Tis manna to the hungry soul newline And to the weary, rest.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>Dear name! the Rock on which I build, newline My shield and hiding place; newline My never failing treasure, newline Filled with boundless stores of grace.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>Jesus, my Shepherd, Brother, Friend, newline My Prophet, Priest, and King newline My Lord, my Life, my Way, my End, newline Accept the praise I bring.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines>Weak is the effort of my heart newline And cold my warmest thought; newline But when I see Thee as Thou art, newline I'll praise Thee as I ought.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v6">
      <lines>Till then I would Thy love proclaim newline With ev'ry fleeting breath; newline And may the music of Thy name newline Refresh my soul in death.</lines>
    </verse>
