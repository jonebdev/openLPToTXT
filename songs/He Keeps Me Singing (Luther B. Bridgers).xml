    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>Jesus, Jesus, Jesus,<br/>Sweetest name I know,<br/>Fills my ev'ry longing,<br/>Keeps me singing as I go.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>There's within my heart a melody.<br/>Jesus whispers sweet and low:<br/>"Fear not, I am with thee; peace, be still,"<br/>In all of life's ebb and flow.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>All my life was wrecked by sin and strife;<br/>Discord filled my life with pain.<br/>Jesus swept across the broken strings,<br/>Stirred the slumb'ring chords again.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>Feasting on the riches of His grace,<br/>Resting 'neath His shelt'ring wing,<br/>Always looking on His smiling face,<br/>That is why I shout and sing.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>Tho' sometimes He leads thro' waters deep,<br/>Trials fall across my way,<br/>Tho' sometimes the path seems rough and steep,<br/>See His footprints all the way.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines>Soon He's coming back to welcome me<br/>Far beyond the starry sky.<br/>I shall wing my flight to worlds unknown;<br/>I shall reign with Him on high.</lines>
    </verse>
