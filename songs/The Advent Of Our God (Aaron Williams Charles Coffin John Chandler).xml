    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>The advent of our God, newline With eager hearts we greet; newline And we must praise Him in this hour, newline With hymns and anthems sweet.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>All glory to the Son, newline Who comes to set us free; newline With Father, Spirit ever One, newline Through all eternity.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>The everlasting Son, newline Incarnate stoops to be; newline Himself the servant's form newline Puts on to set his people free.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>Come, Zion's daughter, newline Rise to meet your lowly King; newline Nor let your faithless heart despise newline The peace He comes to bring.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines>As judge, on clouds of light, newline He soon will come again; newline And all His scattered saints newline Unite with Him on high to reign.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v6">
      <lines>Before the dawning day newline Let sin be put to flight; newline No longer let the law hold sway, newline But walk in freedom's light.</lines>
    </verse>
