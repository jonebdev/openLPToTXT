    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>God moves in a mysterious way newline His glorious wonders to perform; newline He plants His footsteps in the sea newline And rides upon the storm.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Deep in unfathomable mines newline Of never failing skill newline He treasures up His bright designs, newline And works His sovereign will.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>Ye fearful saints, fresh courage take. newline The clouds ye so much dread newline Are big with mercy, and shall break, newline In blessings on your head.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>Judge not the Lord by feeble sense, newline But trust Him for His grace; newline Behind a frowning providence newline He hides a smiling face.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines>His purposes will ripen fast, newline Unfolding every hour: newline The bud may have a bitter taste newline But sweet will be the flower.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v6">
      <lines>Blind unbelief is sure to err, newline And scan His work in vain: newline God is His own interpreter, newline And He will make it plain.</lines>
    </verse>
