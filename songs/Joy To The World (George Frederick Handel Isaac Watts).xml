    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Joy to the world! the Lord is come;<br/>Let earth receive her King.<br/>Let every heart prepare Him room,<br/>And heav'n and nature sing,<br/>And heav'n and nature sing,<br/>And heav'n and heav'n and nature sing.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Joy to the earth! the Savior reigns;<br/>Let men their songs employ.<br/>While fields and floods,<br/>Rocks, hills and plains,<br/>Repeat the sounding joy,<br/>Repeat the sounding joy,<br/>Repeat, repeat the sounding joy.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>No more let sins and sorrows grow,<br/>Nor thorns infest the ground.<br/>He comes to make His blessings flow,<br/>Far as the curse is found,<br/>Far as the curse is found,<br/>Far as, far as the curse is found.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>He rules the world with truth and grace<br/>And makes the nations prove.<br/>The glories of His righteousness<br/>And wonders of His love,<br/>And wonders of His love,<br/>And wonders, and wonders of His love.</lines>
