    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>At the cross, at the cross, newline Where I first saw the light newline And the burden of my heart rolled away; newline It was there by faith, I received my sight newline And now I am happy all the day!</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Alas and did my Savior bleed, newline And did my sov'reign die? newline Would He devote that sacred head, newline For such a worm as I?</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Was it for crimes that I have done, newline He groaned upon the tree? newline Amazing pity grace unknown, newline And love beyond degree!</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>Well might the sun in darkness hide, newline And shut His glories in; newline When Christ the mighty Maker died, newline For man the creature's sin.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>But drops of grief can ne'er repay, newline The debt of love I owe; newline Here, Lord, I give myself to Thee, newline 'Tis all that I can do!</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines>Thus might I hide my blushing face newline While Calvary's cross appears, newline Dissolve my heart in thankfulness, newline And melt mine eyes to tears.</lines>
    </verse>
