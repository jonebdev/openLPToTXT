    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>His power can make you<br/>What you ought to be.<br/>His blood can cleanse your heart<br/>And make you free.<br/>His love can fill your soul<br/>And you will see<br/>'Twas best for Him to have<br/>His way with thee.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Would you live for Jesus,<br/>And be always pure and good?<br/>Would you walk with Him<br/>Within the narrow road?<br/>Would you have Him bear your burden,<br/>Carry all your load?<br/>Let Him have His way with thee.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Would you have Him make you free,<br/>And follow at His call?<br/>Would you know the peace<br/>That comes by giving all?<br/>Would you have Him save you,<br/>So that you need never fall?<br/>Let Him have His way with thee.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>Would you in His kingdom<br/>Find a place of constant rest?<br/>Would you prove Him true<br/>In providential test?<br/>Would you in His service labor<br/>Always at your best?<br/>Let Him have His way with thee.</lines>
