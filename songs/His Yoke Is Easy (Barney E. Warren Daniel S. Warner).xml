    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>His yoke is easy His burden is light, newline I've found it so I've found it so, newline His service is my sweetest delight, newline His blessings ever flow.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>I've found my Lord and He is mine, newline He won me by His love, newline I'll serve Him all my years of time, newline And dwell with Him above.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>No other Lord but Christ I know, newline I walk with Him alone, newline His streams of love forever flow, newline Within my heart His throne.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>He's dearer to my heart than life, newline He found me lost in sin, newline He calmed the sea of inward strife, newline And bid me come to Him.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>My flesh recoiled before the cross, newline And Satan whispers there, newline Thy gain will not repay the loss, newline His yoke is hard to bear.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines>I've tried the road of sin and found, newline Its prospects all deceive, newline I've proved the Lord and joys abound, newline More than I could believe.</lines>
