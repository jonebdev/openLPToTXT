    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>His yoke is easy His burden is light,<br/>I've found it so I've found it so,<br/>His service is my sweetest delight,<br/>His blessings ever flow.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>I've found my Lord and He is mine,<br/>He won me by His love,<br/>I'll serve Him all my years of time,<br/>And dwell with Him above.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>No other Lord but Christ I know,<br/>I walk with Him alone,<br/>His streams of love forever flow,<br/>Within my heart His throne.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>He's dearer to my heart than life,<br/>He found me lost in sin,<br/>He calmed the sea of inward strife,<br/>And bid me come to Him.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>My flesh recoiled before the cross,<br/>And Satan whispers there,<br/>Thy gain will not repay the loss,<br/>His yoke is hard to bear.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines>I've tried the road of sin and found,<br/>Its prospects all deceive,<br/>I've proved the Lord and joys abound,<br/>More than I could believe.</lines>
    </verse>
