    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>And He walks with me,<br/>And He talks with me,<br/>And He tells me I am His own;<br/>And the joy we share as we tarry there,<br/>None other has ever known.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>I come to the garden alone,<br/>While the dew is still on the roses;<br/>And the voice I hear, falling on my ear,<br/>The Son of God discloses.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>He speaks, and the sound of<br/>His voice is so sweet,<br/>The birds hush their singing,<br/>And the melody that He gave to me,<br/>Within my heart is ringing.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>I'd stay in the garden with Him,<br/>Though the night around me be falling,<br/>But He bids me go;<br/>Through the voice of woe,<br/>His voice to me is calling.</lines>
    </verse>
