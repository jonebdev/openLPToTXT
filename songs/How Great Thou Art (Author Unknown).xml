    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>O Lord,my God,when I in awesome wonder consider all the worlds thy hands have made,I see the stars,I hear the rolling thunder,thy power throughout the universe displayed</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Then sings my soul,my savior God, to thy;how great thou art, how great thou art!Then sings my soul my savior God to be;how great thou art how great thou art. <br/>When through the woods and forest glades I wanderand hear the birds sing sweetly in trees;when I look down from lofty mountain grandeur and hear the brook,and feel the gentle breeze;</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>And when I think that God, his Son not sparing,sent him to die, I scarce can take it in; that on the cross, my burden gladly bearing,he bled and died, to take away my sin;</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>When Christ shall come with shout of acclamation and take me home, what joy shall fill my heart.Then I shall bow in humble adoration,and there proclaim,my God, how great thou art!</lines>
    </verse>
