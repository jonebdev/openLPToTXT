      <lines>I am so glad that our Father in heaven<br/>Tells of His love in the book He has giv'n.<br/>Wonderful things in the Bible I see.<br/>This is the dearest that Jesus loves me.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Tho' I forget Him and wander away,<br/>Still He doth love me wherever I stray.<br/>Back to His dear loving arms would I flee<br/>When I remember that Jesus loves me.</lines>

    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>Oh, if there's only one song I can sing,<br/>When in His beauty I see the great King,<br/>This shall my song in eternity be.<br/>Oh what a wonder that Jesus love me.</lines>
