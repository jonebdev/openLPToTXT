    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>For God so loved the world,<br/>That He gave His only begotten Son,<br/>That whosoever believeth in Him,<br/>Whosoever believeth in Him,<br/>Should not perish should not perish,<br/>But have everlasting life.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>A story sweet and wondrous,<br/>Like heavenly music swells.<br/>In chimings clear to all who will hear,<br/>Ring out the gospel bells.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>When, grieving brokenhearted,<br/>Because of sin and shame,<br/>We find a joy earth cannot destroy,<br/>Believing on His name.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>This love, beyond all measure,<br/>Of earth or sea or sky,<br/>Could only show its full overflow,<br/>When Jesus came to die.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>Come, brother come to Jesus,<br/>His word was meant for you;<br/>His grace receive, His promise believe,<br/>And sing His praise anew.</lines>
