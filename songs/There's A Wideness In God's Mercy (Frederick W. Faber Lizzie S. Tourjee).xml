  <lyrics>
    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>There's a wideness in God's mercy<br/>Like the wideness of the sea;<br/>There's a kindness in His justice,<br/>Which is more than liberty.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>There is welcome for the sinner,<br/>And more graces for the good.<br/>There is mercy with the Savior;<br/>There is healing in His blood.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>For the love of God is broader<br/>Than the measure of man's mind;<br/>And the heart of the Eternal<br/>Is most wonderfully kind.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>If our love were but more simple,<br/>We should take Him at His word;<br/>And our lives would be all sunshine<br/>In the sweetness of our Lord.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines>There is plentiful redemption<br/>In the blood that has been shed;<br/>There is joy for all the members<br/>In the sorrows of the Head.</lines>
    </verse>
