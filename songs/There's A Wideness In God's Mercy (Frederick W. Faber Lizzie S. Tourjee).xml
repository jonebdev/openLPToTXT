    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>There's a wideness in God's mercy newline Like the wideness of the sea; newline There's a kindness in His justice, newline Which is more than liberty.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>There is welcome for the sinner, newline And more graces for the good. newline There is mercy with the Savior; newline There is healing in His blood.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>For the love of God is broader newline Than the measure of man's mind; newline And the heart of the Eternal newline Is most wonderfully kind.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>If our love were but more simple, newline We should take Him at His word; newline And our lives would be all sunshine newline In the sweetness of our Lord.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines>There is plentiful redemption newline In the blood that has been shed; newline There is joy for all the members newline In the sorrows of the Head.</lines>
