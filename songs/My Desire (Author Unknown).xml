    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>You want to be real,<br/>You want to be empty inside,<br/>You want to be someone laying down your pride,<br/>You want to be someone someday,<br/>Then Lay it all Down before the King.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>You want to be whole,<br/>You want to have purpose inside,<br/>You want to have virtue and purify your mind<br/>You want to be set free today then lay it all down before the king.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>This is my Desire,<br/>This is my Return,<br/>This is my Desire,<br/>To be Used by You.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>You want to be Real,<br/>You want to be emptied inside,<br/>And I know my heart is to feel you near,<br/>And I know my life is to do your will.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines>It's to do your will,<br/>It's to do your will,</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v6">
      <lines>All my life I have seen where you've taken me,<br/>Beyond all I have hoped and there's more left unseen,<br/>There's not much I can do to repay all you've done,<br/>So I give my hands to Use.</lines>
