    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>Love so divine, love so sublime,<br/>Love that is deeper than any sean;<br/>Love for us all, oh, how can it be!</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>It was love that sent a Savior<br/>To this world of sin and woe,<br/>It was love that left Heaven's portals,<br/>And came down to dwell below;<br/>It was love that stilled the waters<br/>On the stormy Galilee;<br/>It was love that paid sin's ransom,<br/>One dark day on Calvary.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>It was love that heard my pleadings<br/>When I cried out in my sin;<br/>It was love that gave me comfort;<br/>It was love that took me in;<br/>It was love that whispered softly,<br/>"I will never cast you out,"<br/>It was love that eased my heartache;<br/>It was love removed my doubt.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>It is love that still is knocking<br/>At the hearts of sinful men;<br/>It is love that never tires,<br/>But that knocks and knocks again;<br/>It is love that solves all problems<br/>In this world of care and strife;<br/>It is love, the love Jesus,<br/>That gives hope, and peace and life.</lines>
    </verse>
