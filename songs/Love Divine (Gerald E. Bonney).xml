    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>Love so divine, love so sublime, newline Love that is deeper than any sean; newline Love for us all, oh, how can it be!</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>It was love that sent a Savior newline To this world of sin and woe, newline It was love that left Heaven's portals, newline And came down to dwell below; newline It was love that stilled the waters newline On the stormy Galilee; newline It was love that paid sin's ransom, newline One dark day on Calvary.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>It was love that heard my pleadings newline When I cried out in my sin; newline It was love that gave me comfort; newline It was love that took me in; newline It was love that whispered softly, newline "I will never cast you out," newline It was love that eased my heartache; newline It was love removed my doubt.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>It is love that still is knocking newline At the hearts of sinful men; newline It is love that never tires, newline But that knocks and knocks again; newline It is love that solves all problems newline In this world of care and strife; newline It is love, the love Jesus, newline That gives hope, and peace and life.</lines>
