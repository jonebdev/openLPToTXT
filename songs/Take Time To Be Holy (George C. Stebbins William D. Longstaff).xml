    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Take time to be holy.<br/>Speak oft with thy Lord;<br/>Abide in Him always,<br/>And feed on His Word.<br/>Make friends with God's children;<br/>Help those who are weak,<br/>Forgetting in nothing<br/>His blessing to seek.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Take time to be holy.<br/>The world rushes on;<br/>Spend much time in secret<br/>With Jesus alone.<br/>By looking to Jesus,<br/>Like Him thou shalt be;<br/>Thy friends in thy conduct<br/>His likeness shall see.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>Take time to be holy.<br/>Let Him be thy Guide;<br/>And run not before Him,<br/>Whatever betide.<br/>In joy or in sorrow,<br/>Still follow thy Lord,<br/>And, looking to Jesus,<br/>Still trust in His word.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>Take time to be holy,<br/>Be calm in thy soul;<br/>Each thought and each motive<br/>Beneath His control;<br/>Thus led by His Spirit<br/>To fountains of love,<br/>Thou soon shalt be fitted<br/>For service above.</lines>
    </verse>
