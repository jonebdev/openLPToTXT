      <lines>We will worship the Lamb of glory<br/>We will worship the King of kings<br/>We will worship the Lamb of glory<br/>We will worship the King</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>And with our hands lifted high,<br/>We will worship and sing<br/>And with our hands lifted high,<br/>We come before You rejoicing.<br/>With our hands lifted high to the sky<br/>When the world wonders why<br/>We'll just tell them we're loving our King...Oh<br/>We'll just tell them that we're loving our King</lines>
