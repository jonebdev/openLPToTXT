    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>Count your blessings<br/>Name them one by one.<br/>Count your blessings<br/>See what God hath done.<br/>Count your blessings<br/>Name them one by one.<br/>Count your many blessings<br/>See what God hath done.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>When upon life's billows<br/>You are tempest tossed,<br/>When you are discouraged<br/>Thinking all is lost,<br/>Count your many blessings<br/>Name them one by one,<br/>And it will surprise you<br/>What the Lord hath done.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Are you ever burdened<br/>With a load of care,<br/>Does the cross seem heavy<br/>You are called to bear.<br/>Count your many blessings<br/>Every doubt will fly,<br/>And you will be singing<br/>As the days go by.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>When you look at others<br/>With their lands and gold,<br/>Think that Christ has promised<br/>You His wealth untold.<br/>Count your many blessings<br/>Money cannot buy,<br/>Your reward in heaven<br/>Nor your home on high.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>So amid the conflict<br/>Whether great or small,<br/>Do not be discouraged<br/>God is over all.<br/>Count your many blessings<br/>Angels will attend,<br/>Help and comfort give you<br/>To your journey's end.</lines>
    </verse>
