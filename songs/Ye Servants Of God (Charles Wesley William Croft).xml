    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Ye servants of God, your Master proclaim,<br/>And publish abroad His wonderful name;<br/>The name all victorious, of Jesus extol,<br/>His kingdom is glorious, He rules over all.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>God ruleth on high, almighty to save,<br/>And still He is nigh, His presence we have;<br/>The great congregation His triumph shall sing,<br/>Ascribing salvation to Jesus our King.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>Salvation to God who sits on the throne,<br/>Let all cry aloud and honor the Son;<br/>The praises of Jesus the angels proclaim;<br/>Fall down on their faces and worship the Lamb.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>Then let us adore and give Him His right;<br/>All glory and pow'r all wisdom and might.<br/>All honor and blessing with angels above,<br/>And thanks never ceasing and infinite love.<br/>Amen.</lines>
    </verse>
