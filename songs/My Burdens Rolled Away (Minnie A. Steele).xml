    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>Rolled away, rolled away,<br/>I am happy since my burdens rolled away.<br/>Rolled away, rolled away,<br/>I am happy since my burdens rolled away.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>I Remember when my burdens rolled away;<br/>I had carried them for years, night and day.<br/>When I sought the blessed Lord<br/>And I took Him at His word,<br/>Then at once all my burdens rolled away.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>I remember when my burdens rolled away,<br/>That I feared would never leave night or day,<br/>Jesus showed to me the loss,<br/>So I left them at the Cross;<br/>I was glad when my burdens rolled away.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>I remember when my burdens rolled away,<br/>That had hindered me for years,<br/>Night and day.<br/>As I sought the throne of grace,<br/>Just a glimpse of Jesus' face,<br/>And I knew that my burdens<br/>Could not stay.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>I am singing<br/>Since my burdens rolled away;<br/>There's a song within my heart<br/>Night and day.<br/>I am living for my King,<br/>And with joy I shout and sing,<br/>Hallelujah!<br/>All my burdens rolled away!</lines>
    </verse>
