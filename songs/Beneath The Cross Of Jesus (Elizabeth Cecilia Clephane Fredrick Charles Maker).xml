    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Beneath the cross of Jesus newline I fain would take my stand, newline The shadow of a mighty Rock newline Within a weary land. newline A home within the wilderness, newline A rest upon the way, newline From the burning of the noontide heat newline And the burden of the day.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Upon the cross of Jesus newline Mine eyes at times can see newline The very dying form of One newline Who suffered there for me; newline And from my smitten heart with tears newline Two wonders I confess: newline The wonders of redeeming love newline And my unworthiness.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>I take, O cross, thy shadow newline For my abiding place, newline I ask no other sunshine newline Than the sunshine of His face. newline Content to let the world go by, newline To know no gain nor loss, newline My sinful self, my only shame, newline My glory all the cross.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>O safe and happy shelter, newline O refuge tried and sweet, newline O trysting place where heaven's love newline And heaven's justice meet! newline As to the holy patriarch newline That wondrous dream was giv'n, newline So seems my Savior's cross to me, newline A ladder up to heav'n.</lines>
    </verse>
