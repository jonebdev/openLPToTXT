    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>I heard the bells on Christmas day, newline Their old familiar carols play; newline And wild and sweet the words repeat, newline Of peace on earth, good will to men.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>I thought how as the day had come, newline The belfries of all Christendom; newline Had rolled along the unbroken song, newline Of peace on earth, good will to men.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>And in despair I bowed my head, newline "There is no peace on earth," I said; newline "For hate is strong and mocks the song, newline Of peace on earth, good will to men."</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>Then pealed the bells more loud and deep, newline "God is not dead, nor doth He sleep; newline The wrong shall fail, the right prevail, newline With peace on earth, good will to men."</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines>Till ringing, singing on its way, newline The world revolved from night to day; newline A voice, a chime, a chant sublime newline Of peace on earth, good will to men.</lines>
    </verse>
