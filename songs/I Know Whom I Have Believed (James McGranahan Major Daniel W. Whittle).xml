    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>But "I know whom I have believed,<br/>And am persuaded that He is able<br/>To keep that which I've committed,<br/>Unto Him against that day."</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>I know not why God's wondrous grace<br/>To me He hath made known;<br/>Nor why, unworthy, Christ in love<br/>Redeemed me for His own.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>I know not how this saving faith<br/>To me He did impart,<br/>Nor how believing in His word<br/>Wrought peace within my heart.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>I know not how the Spirit moves,<br/>Convincing men of sin,<br/>Revealing Jesus through the Word,<br/>Creating faith in Him.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>I know not what of good or ill<br/>May be reserved for me.<br/>Of weary ways or golden days,<br/>Before His face I see.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines>I know not when my Lord may come,<br/>At night or noonday fair,<br/>Nor if I'll walk the vale with Him,<br/>Or meet Him in the air.</lines>
    </verse>
