    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>Since Jesus came into my heart, newline Since Jesus came into my heart, newline Floods of joy o'er my soul newline Like the sea billows roll, newline Since Jesus came into my heart.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>What a wonderful change newline In my life has been wrought newline Since Jesus came into my heart! newline I have light in my soul, newline For which long I have sought, newline Since Jesus came into my heart.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>I have ceased from my newline Wandering and going astray newline Since Jesus came into my heart; newline And my sins which were many newline Are all washed away, newline Since Jesus came into my heart.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>There's a light in the newline Valley of death now for me, newline Since Jesus came into my heart; newline And the gates of the city newline Beyond I can see, newline Since Jesus came into my heart.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>I shall go there to dwell newline In that city I know, newline Since Jesus came into my heart; newline And I'm happy, so happy, newline As onward I go, newline Since Jesus came into my heart.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines>I'm possessed of a hope newline That is steadfast and sure, newline Since Jesus came into my heart; newline And no dark clouds of doubt newline Now my pathway obscure, newline Since Jesus came into my heart.</lines>
    </verse>
