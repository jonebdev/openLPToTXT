    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>Since Jesus came into my heart,<br/>Since Jesus came into my heart,<br/>Floods of joy o'er my soul<br/>Like the sea billows roll,<br/>Since Jesus came into my heart.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>What a wonderful change<br/>In my life has been wrought<br/>Since Jesus came into my heart!<br/>I have light in my soul,<br/>For which long I have sought,<br/>Since Jesus came into my heart.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>I have ceased from my<br/>Wandering and going astray<br/>Since Jesus came into my heart;<br/>And my sins which were many<br/>Are all washed away,<br/>Since Jesus came into my heart.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>There's a light in the<br/>Valley of death now for me,<br/>Since Jesus came into my heart;<br/>And the gates of the city<br/>Beyond I can see,<br/>Since Jesus came into my heart.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>I shall go there to dwell<br/>In that city I know,<br/>Since Jesus came into my heart;<br/>And I'm happy, so happy,<br/>As onward I go,<br/>Since Jesus came into my heart.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines>I'm possessed of a hope<br/>That is steadfast and sure,<br/>Since Jesus came into my heart;<br/>And no dark clouds of doubt<br/>Now my pathway obscure,<br/>Since Jesus came into my heart.</lines>
    </verse>
