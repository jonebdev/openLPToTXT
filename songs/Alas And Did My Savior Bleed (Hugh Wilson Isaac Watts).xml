    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Alas, and did my Savior bleed newline And did my Sovereign die? newline Would He devote that sacred head, newline For such a worm as I.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Was it for crimes that I have done, newline He suffered on the tree? newline Amazing pity, grace unknown, newline And love beyond degree!</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>Well might the sun in darkness hide newline And shut His glories in; newline When Christ the mighty Maker died newline For man, the creature's sin.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>Thus might I hide my blushing face newline While His dear cross appears; newline Dissolve my heart in thankfulness newline And melt mine eyes to tears.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines>But drops of grief can ne'er repay, newline The debt of love I owe; newline Here, Lord, I give myself away, newline 'Tis all that I can do.</lines>
    </verse>
