    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>You thought of us before the world began to breathe<br/>You knew our names before we came to be<br/>you saw the very day we'd fall away from you<br/>and how desperately we need to be redeemed</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Lord Jesus, come lead us<br/>We're desperate for your touch</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>Oh great and mighty One, with one desire we come<br/>That you would reign, that you would reign in us<br/>We're offering up our lives, a living sacrifice<br/>that you would reign, that you would reign in us.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>Spirit of the Living God, fall fresh again<br/>Come search our hearts and purify our lives<br/>We need your perfect love, we need your discipline<br/>We're lost unless you guide us with your light.</lines>

      <lines>So reign, please reign in us<br/>Come purify our hearts, we need your touch<br/>Come cleanse us likea flood and send us out<br/>So the world may know you reign, You reign in us.</lines>
