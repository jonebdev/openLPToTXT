      <lines>O holy night! newline The stars are brightly shining; newline It is the night newline Of the dear Savior's birth. newline Long lay the world newline In sin and error pining; newline Till He appeared newline And the soul felt its worth. newline A thrill of hope, newline The weary world rejoices; newline For yonder breaks, newline A new and glorious morn. newline Fall on your knees,</lines>

    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Led by the light newline Of faith serenely beaming, newline With glowing hearts newline By His cradle we stand. newline So led by light newline Of a star sweetly gleaming, newline Here came the wise men newline From orient land. newline The King of kings newline Lay thus in lowly manger, newline In all our trials newline Born to be our Friend; newline He knows our need newline To our weakness is no stranger. newline Behold your King newline Before Him lowly bend; newline Behold your King newline Before Him lowly bend!</lines>

    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>Truly He taught us newline To love one another, newline His law is love newline And His gospel is peace; newline Chains shall He break newline For the slave is our brother, newline And in His name newline All oppression shall cease. newline Sweet hymns of joy newline In grateful chorus raise we, newline Let all within us newline Praise His holy name. newline Christ is the Lord newline O praise His name forever. newline His power and glory evermore proclaim; newline His power and glory evermore proclaim.</lines>
