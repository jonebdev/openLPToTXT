    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>Joy bells ringing in your heart!<br/>Joy bells ringing in your heart!<br/>Take the Savior here below<br/>With you ev'rywhere you go;<br/>He will keep the joy bells<br/>Ringing in your heart.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>You may have the joy bells<br/>Ringing in your heart,<br/>And a peace that<br/>From You never will depart.<br/>Walk the straight and narrow way;<br/>Live for Jesus ev'ry day.<br/>He will keep the joy bells<br/>Ringing in your heart.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Love of Jesus in its fullness<br/>You may know,<br/>And this love to those around<br/>You sweetly show.<br/>Words of kindness always say;<br/>Deeds of mercy do each day,<br/>Then He'll keep the joy bells<br/>Ringing in your heart.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>You will meet with trials<br/>As you journey home;<br/>Grace sufficent He will give to overcome.<br/>Tho' unseen by mortal eye,<br/>He is with you evernigh,<br/>And He'll keep the joy bells<br/>Ringing in your heart.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>Let your life speak well<br/>Of Jesus ev'ry day;<br/>Own His right to ev'ry service<br/>You can pay.<br/>Sinners you can help to win<br/>If your life is pure and clean,<br/>And you keep the joy bells<br/>Ringing in your heart.</lines>
