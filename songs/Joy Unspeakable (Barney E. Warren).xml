    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>It is joy unspeakable and full of glory,<br/>Full of glory, full of glory.<br/>It is joy unspeakable and full of glory.<br/>Oh the half has never yet been told!</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>I have found His grace in all complete;<br/>He supplieth every need.<br/>While I sit and learn at Jesus feet,<br/>I am free, yes, free indeed.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>I have found the pleasure I once craved;<br/>It is joy and peace within.<br/>What a wondrous blessing! I am saved<br/>From the awful gulf of sin.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>I have found that hope<br/>so bright and clear,<br/>Living in the realm of grace.<br/>Oh the Savior's presence is so near,<br/>I can see His smiling face.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>I have found the joy no tongue can tell.<br/>How its waves of glory roll!<br/>It is like a great o'er flowing well<br/>Springing up within my soul.</lines>
    </verse>
