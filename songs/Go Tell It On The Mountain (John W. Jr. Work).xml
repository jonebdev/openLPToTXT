    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>Go tell it on the mountain, newline Over the hills and everywhere; newline Go tell it on the mountain, newline That Jesus Christ is born.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Down in a lowly manger, newline The humble Christ was born; newline And brought us God's salvation, newline That blessed Christmas morn.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>When I was a seeker, newline I sought both night and day; newline I asked the Lord to help me, newline And He showed me the way.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>He made me a watchman, newline Upon the city wall; newline And if I am a Christian, newline I am the least of all.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>While shepherds kept their watching, newline O'er silent flocks by night; newline Behold throughout the heavens, newline There shone a holy light.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines>And lo, when they had seen it, newline They all bowed down and prayed; newline They traveled on together newline To where the Babe was laid.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v6">
      <lines>The shepherds feared and trembled, newline When lo above the earth; newline Rang out the angel chorus, newline That hailed our Savior's birth.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v7">
      <lines>When I was a sinner, newline I prayed both night and day; newline I asked the Lord to help me, newline And He showed me the way.</lines>
    </verse>
