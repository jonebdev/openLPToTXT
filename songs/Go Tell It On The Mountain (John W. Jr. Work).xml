    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>Go tell it on the mountain,<br/>Over the hills and everywhere;<br/>Go tell it on the mountain,<br/>That Jesus Christ is born.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Down in a lowly manger,<br/>The humble Christ was born;<br/>And brought us God's salvation,<br/>That blessed Christmas morn.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>When I was a seeker,<br/>I sought both night and day;<br/>I asked the Lord to help me,<br/>And He showed me the way.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>He made me a watchman,<br/>Upon the city wall;<br/>And if I am a Christian,<br/>I am the least of all.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>While shepherds kept their watching,<br/>O'er silent flocks by night;<br/>Behold throughout the heavens,<br/>There shone a holy light.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines>And lo, when they had seen it,<br/>They all bowed down and prayed;<br/>They traveled on together<br/>To where the Babe was laid.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v6">
      <lines>The shepherds feared and trembled,<br/>When lo above the earth;<br/>Rang out the angel chorus,<br/>That hailed our Savior's birth.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v7">
      <lines>When I was a sinner,<br/>I prayed both night and day;<br/>I asked the Lord to help me,<br/>And He showed me the way.</lines>
    </verse>
