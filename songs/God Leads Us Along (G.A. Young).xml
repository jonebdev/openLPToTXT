    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>Some thro' the waters,<br/>Some thro' the flood,<br/>Some thro' the fire,<br/>But all thro' the blood;<br/>Some thro' great sorrow,<br/>But God gives a song,<br/>In the night season,<br/>And all the day long.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>In shady, green pastures,<br/>So rich and so sweet,<br/>God leads His dear children along;<br/>Where the water's cool flow<br/>Bathes the weary one's feet,<br/>God leads His dear children along.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Sometimes on the mount<br/>Where the sun shines so bright,<br/>God leads His dear children along;<br/>Sometimes in the valley,<br/>In darkest of night,<br/>God leads His dear children along.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>Though sorrows befall us<br/>And Satan oppose,<br/>God leads His dear children along;<br/>Through grace we can conquer,<br/>Defeat all our foes,<br/>God leads His dear children along.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>Away from the mire<br/>And away from the clay,<br/>God leads His dear children along;<br/>Away up in glory, eternity's day<br/>God leads His dear children along.</lines>
    </verse>
