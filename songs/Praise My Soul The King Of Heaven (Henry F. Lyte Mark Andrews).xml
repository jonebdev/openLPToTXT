    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Praise Him, for His grace and favor,<br/>To our fathers in distress;<br/>Praise Him, still the same as ever,<br/>Slow to chide and swift to bless,<br/>Alleluia! Alleluia!<br/>Glorious in His faithfulness.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>Frail as summer's flow'r we flourish,<br/>Blows the wind and it is gone;<br/>But while mortals rise and perish,<br/>God endures unchanging on.<br/>Alleluia! Alleluia!<br/>Praise the high Eternal One.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>Angels in the height, adore Him,<br/>Ye behold Him face to face;<br/>Saints triumphant, bow before Him,<br/>Gathered in from every race.<br/>Alleluia! Alleluia!<br/>Praise with us, the God of grace.</lines>
