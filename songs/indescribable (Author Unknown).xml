    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>form the highest of heights to the depths of the sea newline creation revealing your majesty newline from the colors of fall to the fragrance of spring newline every creature unique in the songs that it sings all exclaiming</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>idescribable uncontainable newline you place the stars in the sky and you know them by name newline you are amazing God</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>all powerful untameable newline awestruck we fall to your knees as we humbly proclaim newline your are amazing God</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>who has told every lightning bolt where it should go newline or seen heavenly storehouses laden with snow newline Who imagined the sun and gives source to it's light newline yet conceals to bring us coolness of night, none can fathom</lines>
