    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>The Bible stands tho' the hills may tumble, newline It will firmly stand when the earth shall crumble. newline I will plant my feet on its firm foundation, newline For the Bible stands, the Bible stands.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>The Bible stands like a rock undaunted, newline Mid the raging storms of time. newline Its pages burn with the truth eternal, newline And they glow with a light sublime.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>The Bible stands like a mountain towering, newline Far above the works of man. newline Its truth by none ever was refuted, newline And destroy it they never can.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>The Bible stands, and it will forever, newline When the world has passed away. newline By inspiration it has been given, newline All its precepts I will obey.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>The Bible stands every test we give it, newline For its Author is divine. newline By grace alone I expect to live it, newline And to prove it and make it mine.</lines>
    </verse>
