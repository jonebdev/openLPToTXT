    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Praise my soul, the King of heaven;<br/>To His feet thy tribute bring;<br/>Ransomed, healed, restored, forgiven,<br/>Evermore His praises sing:<br/>Alleluia! Alleluia!<br/>Praise the everlasting King!</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Praise Him for His grace and favor<br/>To our fathers in distress.<br/>Praise Him, still the same forever.<br/>Slow to chide and swift to bless:<br/>Alleluia! Alleluia!<br/>Glorious in His faithfulness!</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>Father-like He tends and spares us.<br/>Well our feeble frame He knows;<br/>In His hands He gently bears us,<br/>Rescues us from all our foes:<br/>Alleluia! Alleluia!<br/>Widely yet His mercy flows!</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>Angels in the height, adore Him,<br/>Ye behold Him face to face;<br/>Sun and moon, bow down before Him,<br/>Dwellers all in time and space:<br/>Alleluia! Alleluia!<br/>Praise with us the God of grace!</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines>Frail as summer's flow'r we flourish;<br/>Blows the wind and it is gone;<br/>But, while mortals rise and perish,<br/>God endures unchanging on:<br/>Praise Him, praise Him,<br/>Praise Him, praise Him,<br/>Praise with us the God of grace.</lines>
