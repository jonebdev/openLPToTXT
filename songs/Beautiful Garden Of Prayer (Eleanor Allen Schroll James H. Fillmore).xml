    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>O the beautiful garden, the garden of prayer,<br/>O the beautiful garden of prayer.<br/>There my Savior awaits, and He opens the gates<br/>To the beautiful garden of prayer.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>There's a garden where Jesus is waiting,<br/>There's a place that is wondrously fair.<br/>For it glows with the light of His presence,<br/>'Tis the beautiful garden of prayer.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>There's a garden where Jesus is waiting,<br/>And I go with my burden and care.<br/>Just to learn from His lips, words of comfort,<br/>In the beautiful garden of prayer.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>There's a garden where Jesus is waiting,<br/>And He bids you to come meet Him there,<br/>Just to bow and receive a new blessing,<br/>In the beautiful garden of prayer.</lines>
    </verse>
