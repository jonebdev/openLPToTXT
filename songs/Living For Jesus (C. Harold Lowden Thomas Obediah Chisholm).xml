    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>O Jesus, Lord and Savior,<br/>I give myself to Thee.<br/>For Thou in Thy atonement,<br/>Didst give Thyself for me.<br/>I own no other master,<br/>My heart shall be Thy throne.<br/>My life I give henceforth to live,<br/>O Christ for Thee alone.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Living for Jesus, a life that is true.<br/>Striving to please Him in all that I do.<br/>Yielding allegiance glad hearted and free.<br/>This is the pathway of blessing for me.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Living for Jesus who died in my place,<br/>Bearing on Calvary, my sin and disgrace.<br/>Such love constrains me, to answer His call,<br/>Follow His leading and give Him my all.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>Living for Jesus, wherever I am.<br/>Doing each duty in His holy name.<br/>Willing to suffer affliction or loss.<br/>Deeming each trial, a part of my cross.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>Living for Jesus, through earth's little while,<br/>My dearest treasure, the light of His smile.<br/>Seeking the lost ones, He died to redeem.<br/>Bringing the weary to find rest in Him.</lines>
    </verse>
