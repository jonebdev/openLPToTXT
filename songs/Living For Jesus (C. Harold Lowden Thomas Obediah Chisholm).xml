    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>O Jesus, Lord and Savior, newline I give myself to Thee. newline For Thou in Thy atonement, newline Didst give Thyself for me. newline I own no other master, newline My heart shall be Thy throne. newline My life I give henceforth to live, newline O Christ for Thee alone.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Living for Jesus, a life that is true. newline Striving to please Him in all that I do. newline Yielding allegiance glad hearted and free. newline This is the pathway of blessing for me.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Living for Jesus who died in my place, newline Bearing on Calvary, my sin and disgrace. newline Such love constrains me, to answer His call, newline Follow His leading and give Him my all.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>Living for Jesus, wherever I am. newline Doing each duty in His holy name. newline Willing to suffer affliction or loss. newline Deeming each trial, a part of my cross.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>Living for Jesus, through earth's little while, newline My dearest treasure, the light of His smile. newline Seeking the lost ones, He died to redeem. newline Bringing the weary to find rest in Him.</lines>
    </verse>
