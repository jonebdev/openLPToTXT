    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>Glory, glory, hallelujah!<br/>Glory, glory, hallelujah!<br/>Glory, glory, hallelujah!<br/>His truth is marching on.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c2">
      <lines>Glory, glory, hallelujah.<br/>Glory, glory, hallelujah.<br/>Glory, glory, hallelujah.<br/>Our God is marching on.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Mine eyes have seen the glory<br/>Of the coming of the Lord;<br/>He is trampling out the vintage<br/>Where the grapes of wrath are stored;<br/>He hath loosed the fateful lightning<br/>Of His terrible swift sword;<br/>His truth is marching on.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>I have seen Him in the watchfires<br/>Of a hundred circling camps;<br/>They have builded Him an altar<br/>In the evening dews and damps;<br/>I can read His righteous sentence<br/>By the dim and flaring lamps;<br/>His day is marching on.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>He has sounded forth the trumpet<br/>That shall never sound retreat;<br/>He is sifting out the hearts of men<br/>Before His judgment seat;<br/>O be swift, my soul, to answer Him!<br/>Be jubilant, my feet!<br/>Our God is marching on.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>In the beauty of the lilies,<br/>Christ was born across the sea,<br/>With a glory in His bosom<br/>That transfigures you and me;<br/>As He died to make men holy,<br/>Let us live to make men free,<br/>While God is marching on.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines>Mine eyes have seen the glory<br/>Of the coming of the Lord;<br/>It is flowing through the cities<br/>And the waste will be restored;<br/>By the leading of the Spirit<br/>And their trusting in His Word,<br/>His army marches on.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v6">
      <lines>Arise and shine my people,<br/>See the glory of the Lord;<br/>As the church with signs and wonders<br/>Marches on in one accord;<br/>His soldiers do not falter<br/>As for Him they wield the sword,<br/>His army marches on.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v7">
      <lines>O join this mighty army<br/>There's a battle to be won;<br/>Let us now put in sickle<br/>For the harvest time has come;<br/>Countless multitudes are waiting<br/>Just to hear of God's own Son,<br/>His army marches on.</lines>
    </verse>
