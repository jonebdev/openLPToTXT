    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Mine eyes have seen the glory newline Of the coming of the Lord; newline He is trampling out the vintage newline Where the grapes of wrath are stored; newline He hath loosed the fateful lightning newline Of His terrible swift sword; newline His truth is marching on.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>I have seen Him in the watchfires newline Of a hundred circling camps; newline They have builded Him an altar newline In the evening dews and damps; newline I can read His righteous sentence newline By the dim and flaring lamps; newline His day is marching on.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>He has sounded forth the trumpet newline That shall never sound retreat; newline He is sifting out the hearts of men newline Before His judgment seat; newline O be swift, my soul, to answer Him! newline Be jubilant, my feet! newline Our God is marching on.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>In the beauty of the lilies, newline Christ was born across the sea, newline With a glory in His bosom newline That transfigures you and me; newline As He died to make men holy, newline Let us live to make men free, newline While God is marching on.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines>Mine eyes have seen the glory newline Of the coming of the Lord; newline It is flowing through the cities newline And the waste will be restored; newline By the leading of the Spirit newline And their trusting in His Word, newline His army marches on.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v6">
      <lines>Arise and shine my people, newline See the glory of the Lord; newline As the church with signs and wonders newline Marches on in one accord; newline His soldiers do not falter newline As for Him they wield the sword, newline His army marches on.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v7">
      <lines>O join this mighty army newline There's a battle to be won; newline Let us now put in sickle newline For the harvest time has come; newline Countless multitudes are waiting newline Just to hear of God's own Son, newline His army marches on.</lines>
