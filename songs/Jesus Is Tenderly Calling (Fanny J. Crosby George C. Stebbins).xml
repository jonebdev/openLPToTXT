      <lines>Calling today, calling today,<br/>Jesus is calling,<br/>Is tenderly calling today.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Jesus is tenderly calling thee home<br/>Calling today, calling today.<br/>Why from the sunshine<br/>Of love wilt thou roam<br/>Farther and farther away?</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Jesus is calling the weary to rest<br/>Calling today, calling today.<br/>Bring Him your burden<br/>And you shall be blest;<br/>He will not turn you away.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>Jesus is waiting; O come to Him now<br/>Waiting today waiting today.<br/>Come with your sins; at His feet lowly bow,<br/>Come and no longer delay.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>Jesus is pleading; O list to His voice<br/>Hear Him today, hear Him today.<br/>They who believe on His name shall rejoice.<br/>Quickly arise and away.</lines>
