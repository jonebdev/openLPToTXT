    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>When I look into Your holiness.<br/>When I gaze into Your loveliness.<br/>When all things that surround become shadows,<br/>In the light of You.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>When I've found the joy of reaching Your heart.<br/>When my will becomes inthroned in Your love.<br/>When all things that surround become shadows,<br/>In the light of You.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>I worship You. I worship You.<br/>The reason I live is to worship You.<br/>2x</lines>
