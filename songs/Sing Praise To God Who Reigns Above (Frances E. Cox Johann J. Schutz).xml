    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Sing praise to God who reigns above, newline The God of all creation; newline The God of pow'r the God of love, newline The God of our salvation. newline With healing balm my soul He fills, newline And ev'ry faithless murmur still; newline To God, all praise and glory.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>What God's almighty pow'r hath made, newline His gracious mercy keepeth; newline By morning glow or evening shade, newline His watchful eye ne'er sleepeth. newline Within the kingdom of His might, newline Lo, all is just and all is right; newline To God, all praise and glory.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>The Lord is never far away, newline But, thru all grief distressing, newline And everpresent help and stay, newline Our peace and joy and blessing. newline As with a mother's tender hand, newline He leads His own, His chosen band, newline To God, all praise and glory.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>Thus all my toilsome way along, newline I sing aloud His praises; newline That men may hear the grateful song. newline My voice unwearied raises, newline Be joyful in the Lord my heart; newline Both soul and body bear your part, newline To God all praise and glory.</lines>
    </verse>
