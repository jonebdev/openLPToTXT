    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Hark! the herald angels sing, newline "Glory to the newborn King; newline Peace on earth and mercy mild, newline God and sinners reconciled." newline Joyful, all ye nations, rise, newline Join the triumph of the skies; newline With angelic hosts proclaim, newline "Christ is born in Bethlehem." newline Hark! the herald angels sing, newline "Glory to the newborn King."</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Christ, by highest heav'n adored, newline Christ, the everlasting Lord; newline Late in time behold Him come, newline Offspring of a virgin's womb. newline Veiled in flesh the Godhead see, newline Hail, the incarnate Deity! newline Pleased as man with men to dwell, newline Jesus our Emmanuel. newline Hark! the herald angels sing, newline "Glory to the newborn King."</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>Hail the heav'n born Prince of Peace! newline Hail the Sun of righteousness! newline Light and life to all He brings, newline Ris'n with healing in His wings. newline Mild He lays His glory by, newline Born that man no more may die; newline Born to raise the sons of earth, newline Born to give them second birth. newline Hark! the herald angels sing, newline "Glory to the newborn King!"</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>Come, Desire of nations, come! newline Fix in us Thy humble home. newline Rise, the woman's conqu'ring seed, newline Bruise in us the serpent's head; newline Adam's likeness now efface, newline Stamp Thine image in its place; newline Second Adam from above, newline Reinstate us in Thy love. newline Hark! the herald angels sing, newline "Glory to the newborn King."</lines>
