    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>The splendor of a King, clothed in majesty,<br/>Let all the earth rejoice, all the earth rejoice,<br/>he wraps himself in light,<br/>and darkness tries to hide<br/>and trembles at his voice, trembles at his voice</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>How Great is our God, sing with me,<br/>How great is our God, all will see<br/>How great, how great is our God</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>Age to age he stands, and time is in his hands,<br/>beginning and the end, beginning and the end.<br/>The godhead, three in one: father, spirit, and son<br/>The lion and the lamb, the lion and the lamb</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>Name above all Names<br/>Worthy of all Praise<br/>and My heart will sing<br/>How Great Is Our God</lines>
