    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>This is my prayer in the fire newline In weakness or trial or pain newline There is a faith proved of more worth than gold newline So refine me Lord through the flame</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>I will bring praise newline I will bring praise newline No weapon formed against me shall remain newline I will rejoice newline I will declare newline God is my victory and He is here</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>This is my prayer in the battle newline When triumph is still on his way newline I am a conqueror and co-heir with Christ newline So firm on His promise I'll stand</lines>
