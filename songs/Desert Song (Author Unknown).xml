    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>This is my prayer in the desert<br/>When all that's within me feels dry<br/>This is my prayer in my hunger and need<br/>My God is the God who provides</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>This is my prayer in the fire<br/>In weakness or trial or pain<br/>There is a faith proved of more worth than gold<br/>So refine me Lord through the flame</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>I will bring praise<br/>I will bring praise<br/>No weapon formed against me shall remain<br/>I will rejoice<br/>I will declare<br/>God is my victory and He is here</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>This is my prayer in the battle<br/>When triumph is still on his way<br/>I am a conqueror and co-heir with Christ<br/>So firm on His promise I'll stand</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines>All of my life in every season<br/>You are still God<br/>I have a reason to sing<br/>I have a reason to worship</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v6">
      <lines>This is my prayer in the harvest<br/>When favor and providence flow<br/>I know I'm filled to be emptied again<br/>The seed I've received I will sow</lines>
    </verse>
