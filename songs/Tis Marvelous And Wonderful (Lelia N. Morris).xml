    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>Wonderful, wonderful,<br/>Marvelous and wonderful<br/>What He has done for my soul!<br/>The half has never been told<br/>Oh, it is wonderful.<br/>It is marvelous and wonderful<br/>What Jesus has done for this soul of mine!<br/>The half has never been told.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>The Savior has come in His mighty power,<br/>And spoken peace to my soul.<br/>And all of my life from that very hour,<br/>I've yielded to His control.<br/>I've yielded to His control.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>'Twas only a foretaste of joys divine<br/>In Canaan waiting for me;<br/>Where sweetest honey and milk and wine<br/>Were dripping from ev'ry tree<br/>Were dripping from ev'ry tree.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>From glory to glory He leads me on<br/>From grace to grace ev'ry day;<br/>And brighter and brighter the glory dawns<br/>While pressing my homeward way<br/>While pressing my homeward way.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>If fellowship here with my Lord can be<br/>So inexpressibly sweet<br/>Oh, what will it be when His face we see<br/>When 'round the white throne we meet.<br/>When 'round the white throne we meet.</lines>
