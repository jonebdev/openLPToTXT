    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Come, Thou fount of every blessing,<br/>Tune my heart to sing Thy grace.<br/>Streams of mercy, never ceasing,<br/>Call for songs of loudest praise.<br/>Teach me some melodious sonnet,<br/>Sung by flaming tongues above.<br/>Praise the mount! I'm fixed upon it,<br/>Mount of God's unchanging love.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Here I raise my Ebenezer;<br/>Hither by Thy help I come.<br/>And I hope, by Thy good pleasure,<br/>Safely to arrive at home.<br/>Jesus sought me when a stranger<br/>Wand'ring from the fold of God;<br/>He, to rescue me from danger,<br/>Interposed His precious blood.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>Oh, to grace how great a debtor<br/>Daily I'm constrained to be!<br/>Let thy grace, Lord, like a fetter,<br/>Bind my wand'ring heart to Thee:<br/>Prone to wander, Lord, I feel it,<br/>Prone to leave the God I love.<br/>Here's my heart, Lord, take and seal it,<br/>Seal it for Thy courts above.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>Hither to Thy love has blest me;<br/>Thou hast bro't me to this place;<br/>And I know Thy hand will bring me<br/>Safely home by Thy good grace.<br/>Jesus sought me when a stranger,<br/>Wandering from the fold of God;<br/>He, to rescue me from danger,<br/>Bought me with His precious blood.</lines>
