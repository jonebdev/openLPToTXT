    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>Yesterday, today, forever,<br/>Jesus is the same.<br/>All may change but Jesus never!<br/>Glory to His name!<br/>Glory to His name!<br/>Glory to His name!<br/>All may change but Jesus never!<br/>Glory to His name!</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Oh how sweet the glorious message<br/>Simple faith may claim:<br/>Yesterday, today, forever,<br/>Jesus is the same!<br/>Still He loves to save the sinful,<br/>Heal the sick and lame,<br/>Cheer the mourner,<br/>Still the tempest.<br/>Glory to His name!</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>He who pardoned erring Peter,<br/>Never need'st thou fear;<br/>He that came to faithless Thomas<br/>All thy doubt will clear.<br/>He who let the loved disciple,<br/>On His bosom rest<br/>Bids thee still,<br/>With love as tender,<br/>Leaning upon His breast.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>He who mid the raging billows<br/>Walked upon the sea<br/>Still can hush our wildest tempest,<br/>As on Galilee.<br/>He who wept and prayed in anguish,<br/>In Gethsemane,<br/>Drinks with us each cup of trembling,<br/>In our agony.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>As of old He walked to Emmaus,<br/>With them to abide,<br/>So through all life's way He walketh,<br/>Ever near our side.<br/>Soon again shall we behold Him.<br/>Hasten, Lord, the day!<br/>But 'twill still be "this same Jesus,"<br/>As He went away.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines>He who was the friend of sinners,<br/>Seeks thee, lost one, now;<br/>Sinner, come and at His footstool<br/>Penitently bow.<br/>He who said, "I'll not condemn thee,<br/>Go and sin no more;"<br/>Speaks to thee that word of pardon,<br/>as in days of yore.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v6">
      <lines>Oft on earth He healed the suff'rer<br/>By His mighty hand;<br/>Still our sicknesses and sorrows<br/>Go at His command.<br/>He who gave His healing virtue,<br/>To a woman's touch;<br/>To the faith that claims His fullness,<br/>Still will give as much.</lines>
    </verse>
