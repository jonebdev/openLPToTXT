    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>He who pardoned erring Peter, newline Never need'st thou fear; newline He that came to faithless Thomas newline All thy doubt will clear. newline He who let the loved disciple, newline On His bosom rest newline Bids thee still, newline With love as tender, newline Leaning upon His breast.</lines>

    <verse name="v6">
      <lines>Oft on earth He healed the suff'rer newline By His mighty hand; newline Still our sicknesses and sorrows newline Go at His command. newline He who gave His healing virtue, newline To a woman's touch; newline To the faith that claims His fullness, newline Still will give as much.</lines>
