    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>I have settled the question, newline Hallelujah! newline I will never turn back newline From the narrow way. newline I am going thro' with Jesus, newline Hallelujah! newline 'Til I reach the gates newline Of glory some sweet day.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>I remember when the Lord newline Spoke to my soul. newline I could feel the heavy burden newline From me roll. newline When He spoke the gracious words, newline "Wilt Thou be whole?" newline Then I settled the question forever.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>I no longer walk the ways newline Of sinfulness, newline But I daily tread newline The paths of righteousness. newline Since the day the Lord newline Has come to my life to bless. newline I have settled the question forever.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>I will choose the holy joys newline That always last. newline And reject sin's pleasures, newline That will soon be past. newline To the treasures of true worth, newline I'm holding fast. newline I have settled the question forever.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>Others may deny the Lord newline And live in sin. newline But the race that I have entered newline I must win. newline Thro' the pearly gates, newline I mean to enter in. newline I have settled the question forever.</lines>
    </verse>
