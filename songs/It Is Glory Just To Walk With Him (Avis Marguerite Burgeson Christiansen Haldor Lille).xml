    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>It is glory, just to walk with Him.<br/>It is glory, just to walk with Him.<br/>He will guide my steps aright,<br/>Thro' the vale and o'er the height.<br/>It is glory, just to walk with Him.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>It is glory, just to walk with Him,<br/>Whose blood has ransomed me.<br/>It is rapture for my soul each day,<br/>It is joy divine to feel,<br/>To feel Him near.<br/>Where'er my path may be,<br/>Bless the Lord,<br/>It's glory all the way.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>It is glory when the shadows fall,<br/>To know that He is near.<br/>Oh what joy to simply trust and pray,<br/>It is glory to abide in Him.<br/>When skies above are clear,<br/>Yes, with Him it's glory all the way.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>'Twill be glory when I walk,<br/>With Him on heaven's golden shore.<br/>Never from His side again to stray,<br/>'Twill be glory, wondrous glory,<br/>With the Savior evermore,<br/>Everlasting glory all the way.</lines>
