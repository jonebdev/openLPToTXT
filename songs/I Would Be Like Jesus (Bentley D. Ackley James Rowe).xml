    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>Be like Jesus, this my song,<br/>In the home and in the throng;<br/>Be like Jesus, all day long!<br/>I would be like Jesus.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Earthly pleasures vainly call me;<br/>I would be like Jesus;<br/>Nothing worldly shall enthrall me;<br/>I would be like Jesus.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>He has broken ev'ry fetter,<br/>I would be like Jesus;<br/>That my soul may serve Him better,<br/>I would be like Jesus.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>All the way from earth to glory,<br/>I would be like Jesus;<br/>Telling o'er and o'er the story,<br/>I would be like Jesus.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>That in heaven He may meet me,<br/>I would be like Jesus;<br/>That His words "Well done," may greet me,<br/>I would be like Jesus.</lines>
