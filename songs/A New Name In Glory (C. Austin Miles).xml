    </verse>
    <verse name="c1b">
      <lines>For there's a new name newline Written down in glory, newline And it's mine, newline O yes it's mine. newline With my sins forgiven newline I am bound for heaven, newline Nevermore to roam.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>I was once a sinner, but I came newline Pardon to receive from my Lord. newline This was freely given, and I found newline That He always kept His word.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>I was humbly kneeling at the Cross, newline Fearing naught but God's angry frown, newline When the heavens opened and I saw newline That my name was written down.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>In the Book 'tis written newline "Saved by grace." newline O the joy that came to my soul! newline Now I am forgiven and I know, newline By the blood I am made whole.</lines>
