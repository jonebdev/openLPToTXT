    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Hosanna, loud hosanna,<br/>The little children sang;<br/>Through pillared court and temple,<br/>The lovely anthem rang.<br/>To Jesus, who had blessed them,<br/>Close folded to His breast;<br/>The children sang their praises,<br/>The simplest and the best.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>From Olivet they followed,<br/>'Mid an exultant crowd;<br/>The victory palm branch waving,<br/>And chanting clear and loud.<br/>The Lord of men and angels,<br/>Rode on in lowly state;<br/>Nor scorned the little children,<br/>Should on His bidding wait.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>"Hosanna in the highest!"<br/>That ancient song we sing;<br/>For Christ is our Redeemer,<br/>The Lord of heaven, our King.<br/>O may we ever praise Him<br/>With heart and life and voice;<br/>And in His holy presence<br/>Eternally rejoice!</lines>
