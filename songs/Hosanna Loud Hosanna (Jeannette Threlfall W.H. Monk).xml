    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Hosanna, loud hosanna, newline The little children sang; newline Through pillared court and temple, newline The lovely anthem rang. newline To Jesus, who had blessed them, newline Close folded to His breast; newline The children sang their praises, newline The simplest and the best.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>From Olivet they followed, newline 'Mid an exultant crowd; newline The victory palm branch waving, newline And chanting clear and loud. newline The Lord of men and angels, newline Rode on in lowly state; newline Nor scorned the little children, newline Should on His bidding wait.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>"Hosanna in the highest!" newline That ancient song we sing; newline For Christ is our Redeemer, newline The Lord of heaven, our King. newline O may we ever praise Him newline With heart and life and voice; newline And in His holy presence newline Eternally rejoice!</lines>
