    <verse name="v1a">
      <lines>Over the mountains and the sea your river runs with love for me and I will open my heart and let the Healer set me free</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v1b">
      <lines>I'm happy to be in the truth and I will daily lift my hands for I will always sing of when your love came down</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>I could sing of your love forever, I could sing of your love forever</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="b1">
      <lines>Oh, I feel like dancing it's foolishness I know, but when the world has seen the light they will dance with joy like we're dancing now</lines>
