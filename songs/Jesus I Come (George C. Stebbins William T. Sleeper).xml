      <lines>Out of my bondage, sorrow and night, newline Jesus, I come; Jesus I come. newline Into Thy freedom, gladness and light, newline Jesus, I come to Thee. newline Out of my sickness into Thy health, newline Out of my want and into Thy wealth. newline Out of my sin and into thyself, newline Jesus, I come to Thee.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Out of my shameful failure and loss, newline Jesus, I come; Jesus, I come. newline Into the glorious gain of Thy cross, newline Jesus, I come to Thee. newline Out of earth's sorrows into Thy balm, newline Out of life's storms and into Thy calm. newline Out of distress to jubilant psalm, newline Jesus, I come to Thee.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>Out of unrest and arrogant pride, newline Jesus, I come; Jesus, I come. newline Into Thy blessed will to abide, newline Jesus, I come to Thee. newline Out of myself to dwell in Thy love, newline Out of despair into raptures above, newline Upward for aye on wings like a dove, newline Jesus, I come to Thee.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>Out of the fear and dread of the tomb, newline Jesus, I come; Jesus I come. newline Into the joy and light of Thy home, newline Jesus, I come to Thee. newline Out of the depths of ruin untold, newline Into the peace of Thy sheltering fold. newline Ever Thy glorious face to behold, newline Jesus, I come to Thee.</lines>
