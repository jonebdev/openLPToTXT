    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>Amazing love! How can it be<br/>That Thou, my God, shouldst die for me?</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>And can it be that I should gain<br/>An interest in the Savior's blood?<br/>Died He for me, who caused His pain?<br/>For me, who Him to death pursued?</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>He left His Father's throne above,<br/>So free, so infinite His grace;<br/>Emptied Himself of all but love,<br/>And bled for Adam's helpless race.<br/>'Tis mercy all, immense and free!<br/>For, O my God it found out me!</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>No condemnation now I dread;<br/>Jesus, and all in Him, is mine!<br/>Alive in Him my living Head,<br/>And clothed in righteousness divine,<br/>Bold I approach the eternal throne,<br/>And claim the crown, through Christ my own.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>'Tis mystery all! The Immortal dies!<br/>Who can explore His strange design?<br/>In vain the first born seraph tries<br/>To sound the depths of love divine!<br/>'Tis mercy all! Let earth adore,<br/>Let angel minds inquire no more.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines>Long my imprisoned Spirit lay<br/>Fast bound in sin and nature's night;<br/>Thine eye diffused a quickening ray,<br/>I woke, the dungeon flamed with light;<br/>My chains fell off, my heart was free;<br/>I rose, went forth and followed Thee.</lines>
    </verse>
