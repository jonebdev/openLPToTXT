    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>'Twas a glad day when Jesus found me.<br/>When His strong arms were thrown around me,<br/>When my sins He buried in the deepest sea,<br/>And my soul He filled with joy and victory.<br/>'Twas a glad day, O hallelujah.<br/>'Twas a glad day He claimed His own.<br/>I will shout a glad hosanna in glory,<br/>When I see Him upon His throne.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>I was lost in sin when Jesus found me.<br/>But He rescued me, all glory to His name.<br/>And the cords of worldly pleasure bound me,<br/>'Til He saved me from sin and shame.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Oh, the bells of heaven now are ringing,<br/>For I hear their tones within my ransomed soul.<br/>And my heart is filled with joyful singing,<br/>Since the Savior hath made me whole.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>Oh, the joy when we shall meet in glory,<br/>In the mansions of my Father's home above.<br/>And through endless ages tell the story,<br/>Of the Savior's redeeming love.</lines>
    </verse>
