    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>I will follow where He leadeth; newline I will pasture where He feedeth. newline I will follow all the way, Lord. newline I will follow Jesus ev'ry day.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Oh, I love to walk with Jesus, newline Like the publicans of old. newline When He gathered them about Him newline And the blessed tidings told: newline How He came to bring deliv'rance newline To the captives in distress. newline Take away our ev'ry burden, newline Giving perfect peace and rest.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>O I love to walk with Jesus newline Like the man of long ago newline Who had tarried by the wayside newline Near the gates of Jericho. newline Jesus heard his cry for mercy, newline Gave him back his sight that day, newline And immediately he followed Jesus newline All along the way.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>O I love to walk with Jesus newline All the way to Calv'ry's brow, newline Gaze upon that scene of suff'ring newline While my tears of sorrow flow. newline There He tells me how He loves me, newline Takes my ev'ry sin away; newline So I follow Him so gladly, newline Lead me anywhere He may.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>O sometime I'll walk with Jesus newline In the land of endless day, newline When our journey here is over newline And we've reached our home to stay. newline Then I'll walk with Him forever, newline Sing His praises o'er and o'er, newline And with all the saints in glory newline Love and worship and adore.</lines>
    </verse>
