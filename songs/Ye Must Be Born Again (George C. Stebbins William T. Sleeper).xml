    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>A ruler once came<br/>To Jesus by night<br/>To ask Him the way<br/>Of salvation and light.<br/>The Master made answer<br/>In words true and plain,<br/>"Ye must be born again."</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Ye children of men,<br/>Attend to the word<br/>So solemnly uttered<br/>By Jesus, the Lord;<br/>And let not this message<br/>To you be in vain,<br/>"Ye must be born again."</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>O ye who would enter<br/>That glorious rest,<br/>And sing with the ransomed<br/>The song of the blest,<br/>The life everlasting<br/>If ye would obtain,<br/>"Ye must be born again."</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>A dear one in heaven<br/>Thy heart yearns to see,<br/>At the beautiful gate<br/>May be watching for thee;<br/>Then list to the note<br/>Of this solemn refrain,<br/>"Ye must be born again."</lines>
