    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Begin my tongue some heav'nly theme newline And speak some boundless thing; newline The mighty works or mightier name, newline Of our eternal King.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Tell of His wondrous faithfulness newline And sound His pow'r abroad; newline Sing the sweet promise of His grace, newline The love and truth of God.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>His very word of grace is strong, newline As that which built the skies; newline The voice that roles the stars along, newline Speaks all the promises.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>O might I hear Thy heav'nly tongue, newline But whisper Thou art mine; newline Those gentle words shall raise my song, newline To notes almost divine.</lines>
