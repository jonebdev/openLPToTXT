    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>As discussed last week,<br/>God has a purpose for every<br/>single situation that you go<br/>through in your life.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>It is up to you whether you<br/>want to trust God through your<br/>difficulties or to turn your back and run.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>Have you ever been put in a situation where God was pressing for you to do something but you were overcome with fear? Embarressment? Anxiousness? Did you overcome your fear and complete what you felt God wanted you to do or did you ignore God's calling?</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>Maybe God wants to use you to reach that coworker down the hall.<br/>Maybe it's that friend you would rather get a drink with then speak to about God's grace.<br/>Maybe it's your mother or father who need to hear your testimony, but you're afraid they'll be disappointed.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines>Even though sometimes it is easier to run, think about why you feel God is leading you to do that thing that he wants you to do. He may want to bless you through the situation, but a lot of the times we don't allow him to. Whether or not you muster up the courage to follow God's calling, his will will be completed whether through you or not.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v6">
      <lines>Please read:</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v7">
      <lines>Luke 22:42</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v8">
      <lines>Esther 4:12-16</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v9">
      <lines>Jeremiah 29:10-15</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v10">
      <lines>1. Think about a time in your life that you know God appointed you "for such a time" as that.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v11">
      <lines>2. Why do you think that God chooses certain people to accomplish certain things when he is all powerful and can get that thing done by himself? Or use an animal to get it done (Numbers 22: 21-35).</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v12">
      <lines>3. Think of a time where you did follow God's lead. How did you feel during and after?</lines>
    </verse>
