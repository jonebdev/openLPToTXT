    </verse>
    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Softly and tenderly Jesus is calling,<br/>Calling for you and for me.<br/>See, on the portals,<br/>He's waiting and watching,<br/>Watching for you and for me.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Why should we tarry<br/>When Jesus is pleading,<br/>Pleading for you and for me?<br/>Why should we linger<br/>And heed not His mercies,<br/>Mercies for you and for me?</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>Time is now fleeting;<br/>The moments are passing,<br/>Passing from you and from me.<br/>Shadows are gathering;<br/>Death's night is coming,<br/>Coming for you and for me.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>Oh for the wonderful<br/>Love He has promised,<br/>Promised for you and for me!<br/>Though we have sinned,<br/>He has mercy and pardon,<br/>Pardon for you and for me.</lines>
