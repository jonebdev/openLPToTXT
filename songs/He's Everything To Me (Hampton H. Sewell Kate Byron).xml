    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>He's ev'rything to me.<br/>From sin He sets me free;<br/>His peace and love my portion<br/>Thro' all eternity!<br/>He's ev'rything to me,<br/>More than I dreamed could be.<br/>O praise His name forever!<br/>He's ev'rything to me.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>In sin I once had wandered,<br/>All weary, sad and lone,<br/>Till Jesus through His mercy<br/>Adopted me His own.<br/>Ever since I learned to trust Him,<br/>His grace doth make me free,<br/>And now I feel His pardon,<br/>He's everything to me.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>In sin no more I'll wander;<br/>He's Pilot, Friend and Guide.<br/>He brings me joy and singing.<br/>His Spirit doth abide.<br/>A blessed, loving Savior,<br/>The Lamb of Calvary!<br/>He purchased my redemption.<br/>He's ev'rything to me.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>No longer will I stray<br/>From His tender, loving care;<br/>Like Him to be my purpose,<br/>My aim, my constant prayer.<br/>And when He bids me welcome<br/>Thro'out eternity,<br/>I'll praise His name forever.<br/>He's ev'rything to me.</lines>
    </verse>
