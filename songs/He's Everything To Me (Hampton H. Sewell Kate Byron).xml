      <lines>He's ev'rything to me. newline From sin He sets me free; newline His peace and love my portion newline Thro' all eternity! newline He's ev'rything to me, newline More than I dreamed could be. newline O praise His name forever! newline He's ev'rything to me.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>In sin I once had wandered, newline All weary, sad and lone, newline Till Jesus through His mercy newline Adopted me His own. newline Ever since I learned to trust Him, newline His grace doth make me free, newline And now I feel His pardon, newline He's everything to me.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>In sin no more I'll wander; newline He's Pilot, Friend and Guide. newline He brings me joy and singing. newline His Spirit doth abide. newline A blessed, loving Savior, newline The Lamb of Calvary! newline He purchased my redemption. newline He's ev'rything to me.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>No longer will I stray newline From His tender, loving care; newline Like Him to be my purpose, newline My aim, my constant prayer. newline And when He bids me welcome newline Thro'out eternity, newline I'll praise His name forever. newline He's ev'rything to me.</lines>
