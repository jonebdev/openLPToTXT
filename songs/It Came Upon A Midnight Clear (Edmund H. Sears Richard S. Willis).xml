    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>It came upon the midnight clear,<br/>That glorious song of old;<br/>From angels bending near the earth<br/>To touch their harps of gold.<br/>"Peace on the earth good will to men,<br/>From heaven's all gracious King!"<br/>The world in solemn stillness lay<br/>To hear the angels sing.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Still thro' the cloven skies they come,<br/>With peaceful wings unfurled;<br/>And still their heavenly music floats,<br/>O'er all the weary world.<br/>Above its sad and lowly plains,<br/>They bend on hovering wing;<br/>And ever o'er its Babel sounds<br/>The blessed angels sing.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>And ye, beneath life's crushing load,<br/>Whose forms are bending low;<br/>Who toil along the climbing way<br/>With painful steps and slow.<br/>Look now! for glad and golden hours,<br/>Come swiftly on the wing;<br/>O rest beside the weary road,<br/>And hear the angels sing.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>For lo, the days are hastening on,<br/>By prophet bards foretold;<br/>When with the ever circling years,<br/>Comes round the age of gold.<br/>When peace shall over all the earth,<br/>Its ancient splendors fling;<br/>And the whole world give back the song<br/>Which now the angels sing.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines>Yet with the woes of sin and strife<br/>The world has suffered long;<br/>Beneath the angel strain have rolled,<br/>Two thousand years of wrong.<br/>And man, at war with man, hears not,<br/>The love song which they bring;<br/>O hush the noise, ye men of strife,<br/>And hear the angels sing.</lines>
    </verse>
