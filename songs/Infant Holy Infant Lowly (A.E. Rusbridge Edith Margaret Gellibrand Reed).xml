    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Infant holy, infant lowly, newline For His bed a cattle stall; newline Oxen lowing, little knowing, newline Christ the babe is Lord of all. newline Swift are winging, angels singing, newline Noels ringing, tidings bringing: newline Christ the Babe is Lord of all. newline Christ the Babe is Lord of all.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Flocks were sleeping, newline Shepherds keeping vigil newline Till the morning new; newline Saw the glory, heard the story, newline Tidings of a gospel true. newline Thus rejoicing, free from sorrow, newline Praises voicing, greet the morrow: newline Christ the Babe was born for you. newline Christ the Babe was born for you.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>In a manger He is lying, newline Who will greet Him as He sleeps? newline Baby Jesus, infant Christ child, newline Who will greet Him as He sleeps? newline Angels winging, praises singing, newline Noels ringing, tidings bringing: newline Christ the Babe is Lord of all. newline Christ the Babe is Lord of all.</lines>
