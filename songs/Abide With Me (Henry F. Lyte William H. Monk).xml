    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Abide with me! newline Fast falls the eventide. newline The darkness deepens; newline Lord, with me abide! newline When other helpers fail newline And comforts flee, newline Help of the helpless, newline Oh abide with me!</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Swift to its close ebbs out newline Life's little day. newline Earth's joys grow dim; newline Its glories pass away. newline Change and decay newline In all around I see; newline O Thou, who changest not, newline Abide with me!</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>I need Thy presence newline Every passing hour. newline What but Thy grace newline Can foil the tempter's power? newline Who, like Thyself, newline My guide and stay can be? newline Through cloud and sunshine, newline Lord, abide with me.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>I fear no foe, newline With Thee at hand to bless; newline Ills have no weight, newline And tears no bitterness. newline Where is death's sting? newline Where, grave, thy victory? newline I triumph still, newline If Thou abide with me.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines>Hold Thou Thy cross newline Before my closing eyes; newline Shine through the gloom newline And point me to the skies. newline Heaven's morning breaks, newline And earth's vain shadows flee! newline In life, in death, newline O Lord, abide with me!</lines>
    </verse>
