    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>Love lifted me!<br/>Love lifted me!<br/>When nothing else could help,<br/>Love lifted me.<br/>Love lifted me.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>I was sinking deep in sin,<br/>Far from the peaceful shore,<br/>Very deeply stained within,<br/>Sinking to rise no more.<br/>But the Master of the sea<br/>Heard my despairing cry,<br/>From the waters lifted me;<br/>Now safe am I.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>All my heart to Him I give;<br/>Ever to Him I'll cling,<br/>In His blessed presence live,<br/>Ever His praises sing.<br/>Love so mighty and so true<br/>Merits my soul's best songs;<br/>Faithful, loving service, too,<br/>To Him belongs.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>Souls in danger, look above;<br/>Jesus completely saves.<br/>He will lift you by His love<br/>Out of the angry waves.<br/>He's the Master of the sea,<br/>Billows His will obey.<br/>He your Savior wants to be,<br/>Be saved today.</lines>
    </verse>
