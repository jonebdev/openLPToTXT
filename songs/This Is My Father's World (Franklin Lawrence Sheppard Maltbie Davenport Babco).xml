    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>This is my Father's world, newline And to my listening ears; newline All nature sings and round me rings newline The music of the spheres. newline This is my Father's world; newline I rest me in the thought newline Of rocks and trees, of skies and seas; newline His hand the wonders wrought.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>This is my Father's world; newline The birds their carols raise. newline The morning light, the lily white, newline Declare their Maker's praise; newline This is my Father's world; newline He shines in all that's fair; newline In the rustling grass I hear Him pass, newline He speaks to me everywhere.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>This is my Father's world, newline O let me ne'er forget newline That though the wrong seems oft so strong, newline God is the Ruler yet. newline This is my Father's world; newline The battle is not done; newline Jesus, who died, shall be satisfied, newline And earth and heaven be one.</lines>
