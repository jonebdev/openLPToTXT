    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Praise the Lord! ye heav'ns, adore Him;<br/>Praise Him, angels, in the height;<br/>Sun and moon, rejoice before Him;<br/>Praise Him, all ye stars of light.<br/>Praise the Lord! for He hath spoken.<br/>Worlds His mighty voice obeyed;<br/>Laws which never shall be broken<br/>For their guidance He hath made.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Praise the Lord! For He is glorious;<br/>Never shall His promise fail;<br/>God hath made His saints victorious;<br/>Sin and death shall not prevail.<br/>Praise the God of our salvation!<br/>Hosts on high, His power proclaim;<br/>Heaven, and earth and all creation,<br/>Laud and magnify His name.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>Worship, honor, glory, blessing,<br/>Lord, we offer unto Thee;<br/>Young and old, Thy praise expressing,<br/>In glad homage bend the knee;<br/>All the saints in heaven adore Thee;<br/>We would bow before Thy throne.<br/>As Thine angels serve before Thee,<br/>So on earth Thy will be done.</lines>
