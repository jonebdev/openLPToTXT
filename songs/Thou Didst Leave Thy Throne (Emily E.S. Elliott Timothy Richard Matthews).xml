    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>O come to my heart, Lord Jesus. newline There is room in my heart for Thee.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c2">
      <lines>My heart shall rejoice, Lord Jesus, newline When Thou comest and callest for me.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Thou didst leave Thy throne newline And Thy kingly crown, newline When Thou camest to earth for me. newline But in Bethlehem's home newline Was there found no room newline For Thy holy nativity.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Heaven's arches rang, newline When the angels sang, newline Proclaiming Thy royal decree; newline But of lowly birth, newline Didst Thou come to earth newline And in great humility.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>The foxes found rest newline And the birds their nest, newline In the shade of the forest tree; newline But Thy couch was the sod, newline O Thou Son of God, newline In the deserts of Galilee.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>Thou camest, O Lord, newline With the living word, newline That should set Thy people free; newline But with mocking scorn newline And with crown of thorn, newline They bore Thee to Calvary.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines>When the heaven's shall ring newline And the angels sing, newline At Thy coming to victory; newline Let Thy voice call me home, newline Saying, "Yet there is room, newline There is room at My side for thee."</lines>
    </verse>
