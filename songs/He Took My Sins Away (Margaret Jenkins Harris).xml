    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>He took my sins away,<br/>He took my sins away,<br/>And keeps me singing every day!<br/>I'm so glad He took my sins away.<br/>He took my sins away.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>I came to Jesus, weary, worn and sad.<br/>He took my sins away;<br/>He took my sins away.<br/>And now His love has made<br/>My heart so glad.<br/>He took my sins away.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>The load of sin was more<br/>Than I could bear.<br/>He took them all away;<br/>He took them all away.<br/>And now on Him I roll<br/>My every care.<br/>He took my sins away.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>No condemnation have I in my heart.<br/>He took my sins away;<br/>He took my sins away.<br/>His perfect peace He did to me impart.<br/>He took my sins away.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>If You will come to Jesus Christ today,<br/>He'll take Your sins away,<br/>He'll take Your sins away,<br/>And keep You happy in His love each day.<br/>He'll take Your sins away.</lines>
