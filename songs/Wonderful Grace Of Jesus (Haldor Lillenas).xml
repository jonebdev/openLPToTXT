    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>Wonderful, the matchless grace of Jesus. newline Deeper than the mighty rolling sea. newline Higher than the mountains newline Sparkling like a fountain, newline All sufficient grace for even me. newline Broader than the scope newline Of my transgressions. newline Greater far than all my sin and shame. newline O, magnify the precious name of Jesus! newline Praise His name!</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Wonderful grace of Jesus, newline Greater than all my sin. newline How shall my tongue describe it? newline Where shall its praise begin? newline Taking away my burden, newline Setting my Spirit free. newline For wonderful grace of Jesus reaches me.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Wonderful grace of Jesus, newline Reaching to all the lost. newline By it I have been pardoned, newline Saved to the uttermost. newline Chains have been torn asunder, newline Giving me liberty. newline For the wonderful grace newline Of Jesus reaches me.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>Wonderful grace of Jesus, newline Reaching the most defiled. newline By its transforming power newline Making Him God's dear child. newline Purchasing peace and heaven newline For all eternity. newline And the wonderful grace newline Of Jesus reaches me.</lines>
