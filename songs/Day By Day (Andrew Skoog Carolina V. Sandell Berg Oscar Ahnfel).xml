    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Day by day and with each passing moment, newline Strength I find to meet my trials here; newline Trusting in my Father's wise bestowment, newline I've no cause for worry or for fear. newline He whose heart is kind beyond all measure, newline Give unto each day what He deems best; newline Lovingly, its part of pain and pleasure, newline Mingling toil with peace and rest.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Ev'ry day the Lord Himself is near me newline With a special mercy for each hour; newline All my cares He fain would bear and cheer me, newline He whose name is Counselor and Pow'r. newline The protection of His child and treasure, newline Is a charge that on Himself He laid; newline "As your days, your strength shall be in measure," newline This the pledge to me He made.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>Help me then in ev'ry tribulation, newline So to trust Your promises, O Lord; newline That I lose not faith's sweet consolation, newline Offered me within Your holy Word. newline Help me, Lord, when toil and trouble meeting, newline E'er to take, as from a Father's hand, newline One by one, the days, the moments fleeting, newline Till I reach the promised land.</lines>
