    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Day by day and with each passing moment,<br/>Strength I find to meet my trials here;<br/>Trusting in my Father's wise bestowment,<br/>I've no cause for worry or for fear.<br/>He whose heart is kind beyond all measure,<br/>Give unto each day what He deems best;<br/>Lovingly, its part of pain and pleasure,<br/>Mingling toil with peace and rest.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Ev'ry day the Lord Himself is near me<br/>With a special mercy for each hour;<br/>All my cares He fain would bear and cheer me,<br/>He whose name is Counselor and Pow'r.<br/>The protection of His child and treasure,<br/>Is a charge that on Himself He laid;<br/>"As your days, your strength shall be in measure,"<br/>This the pledge to me He made.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>Help me then in ev'ry tribulation,<br/>So to trust Your promises, O Lord;<br/>That I lose not faith's sweet consolation,<br/>Offered me within Your holy Word.<br/>Help me, Lord, when toil and trouble meeting,<br/>E'er to take, as from a Father's hand,<br/>One by one, the days, the moments fleeting,<br/>Till I reach the promised land.</lines>
