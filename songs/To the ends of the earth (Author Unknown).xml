    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Love unfailing, overtaking my heart<br/>You take me in<br/>finding peace again, fear is lost in all you are</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>I would give the world to tell your story<br/>Cause I know that you've called me<br/>I know that you've called me<br/>I've lost myself for good within your promise<br/>And I won't hide it, I won't hide it</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>Jesus I believe in you and I would go<br/>To the ends of the earth,<br/>To the ends of the earth, for you<br/>Alone are the son of God and all the world will see<br/>That you are God, You are God.</lines>
