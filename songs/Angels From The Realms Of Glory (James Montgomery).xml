    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Angels from the realms of glory,<br/>Wing your flight o'er all the earth;<br/>Ye who sang creation's story,<br/>Now proclaim Messiah's birth.<br/>Come and worship, come and worship;<br/>Worship Christ, the new-born King!</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Shepherds in the fields abiding,<br/>Watching o'er your flocks by night;<br/>God with man is now residing,<br/>Yonder shines the infant Light.<br/>Come and worship, come and worship;<br/>Worship Christ, the new-born King!</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>Sages, leave your contemplation's,<br/>Brighter visions beam afar;<br/>Seek the great Desire of nations,<br/>Ye have seen His natal star.<br/>Come and worship, come and worship;<br/>Worship Christ, the new-born King!</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>Saints, before the altar bending,<br/>Watching long in hope and fear;<br/>Suddenly the Lord, descending,<br/>In His temple shall appear.<br/>Come and worship, come and worship;<br/>Worship Christ, the new-born King!</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines>All creation, join in praising,<br/>God, the Father, Spirit, Son;<br/>Evermore your voices raising,<br/>To the eternal Three in One.<br/>Come and worship, come and worship;<br/>Worship Christ, the new-born King!</lines>
    </verse>
