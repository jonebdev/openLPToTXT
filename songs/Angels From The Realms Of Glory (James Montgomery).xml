    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Angels from the realms of glory, newline Wing your flight o'er all the earth; newline Ye who sang creation's story, newline Now proclaim Messiah's birth. newline Come and worship, come and worship; newline Worship Christ, the new-born King!</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Shepherds in the fields abiding, newline Watching o'er your flocks by night; newline God with man is now residing, newline Yonder shines the infant Light. newline Come and worship, come and worship; newline Worship Christ, the new-born King!</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>Sages, leave your contemplation's, newline Brighter visions beam afar; newline Seek the great Desire of nations, newline Ye have seen His natal star. newline Come and worship, come and worship; newline Worship Christ, the new-born King!</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>Saints, before the altar bending, newline Watching long in hope and fear; newline Suddenly the Lord, descending, newline In His temple shall appear. newline Come and worship, come and worship; newline Worship Christ, the new-born King!</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines>All creation, join in praising, newline God, the Father, Spirit, Son; newline Evermore your voices raising, newline To the eternal Three in One. newline Come and worship, come and worship; newline Worship Christ, the new-born King!</lines>
    </verse>
