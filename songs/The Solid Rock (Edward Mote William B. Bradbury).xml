    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>On Christ the solid Rock I stand, newline All other ground is sinking sand. newline All other ground is sinking sand.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>My hope is built on nothing less newline Than Jesus' blood and righteousness. newline I dare not trust the sweetest frame, newline But wholly lean on Jesus' name.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>When darkness seems to hide His face, newline I rest on His unchanging grace. newline In every high and stormy gale, newline My anchor holds within the veil.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>His oath, His covenant, His blood, newline Support me in the whelming flood. newline When all around my soul gives way, newline He then is all my Hope and Stay.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>When He shall come with trumpet sound, newline O may I then in Him be found! newline Dressed in His righteousness alone, newline Faultless to stand before the throne!</lines>
    </verse>
