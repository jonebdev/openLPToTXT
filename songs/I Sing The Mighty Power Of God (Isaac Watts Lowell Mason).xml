      <lines>I sing the mighty power of God,<br/>That made the mountains rise;<br/>That spread the flowing seas abroad,<br/>And built the lofty skies,<br/>That spread the flowing seas abroad,<br/>And built the lofty skies.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>I sing the goodness of the Lord,<br/>That filled the earth with food;<br/>He formed the creatures with His word,<br/>And then pronounced them good,<br/>He formed the creatures with His word,<br/>And then pronounced them good.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>There's not a plant or flower below,<br/>But makes Thy glories known;<br/>And clouds arise, and tempests blow,<br/>By order from Thy throne;<br/>And clouds arise, and tempests blow,<br/>By order from Thy throne.<br/>Amen.</lines>
