      <lines>Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel,<br/>Born is the King of Israel.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>The first Noel,<br/>The angel did say,<br/>Was to certain poor shepherds,<br/>In fields as they lay;<br/>In fields where they<br/>Lay keeping their sheep,<br/>On a cold winter's night<br/>That was so deep.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>They looked up and saw a star<br/>Shining in the east,<br/>Beyond them far,<br/>And to the earth<br/>It gave great light,<br/>And so it continued<br/>Both day and night.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>And by the light<br/>Of that same star,<br/>Three wise men came<br/>From country far;<br/>To seek for a King<br/>Was their intent,<br/>And to follow the star,<br/>Wherever it went.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>This star drew nigh<br/>To the northwest,<br/>O'er Bethlehem<br/>It took its rest,<br/>And there it did<br/>Both stop and stay,<br/>Right over the place<br/>Where Jesus lay.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines>Then entered in<br/>Those wise men three,<br/>Full rev'rently<br/>Upon their knee,<br/>And offered there<br/>In His presence,<br/>Their gold, and myrrh,<br/>And frankincense.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v6">
      <lines>Then let us all<br/>With one accord,<br/>Sing praises to<br/>Our heavenly Lord,<br/>That hath made heav'n<br/>And earth of naught,<br/>And with His blood<br/>Mankind hath bought.</lines>
