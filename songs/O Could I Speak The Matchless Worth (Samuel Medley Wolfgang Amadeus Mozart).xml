    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>O could I speak the matchless worth,<br/>O could I sound the glories forth,<br/>Which in my Savior shine?<br/>I'd sing His glorious righteousness<br/>And magnify the wondrous grace<br/>Which made salvation mine;<br/>Which made salvation mine.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>I'd sing the precious blood He spilt,<br/>My ransom from the dreadful guilt<br/>Of sin, and wrath divine;<br/>I'd sing His glorious righteousness,<br/>In which all perfect, heavenly dress,<br/>My soul shall ever shine;<br/>My soul shall ever shine.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>I'd sing the characters He bears<br/>And all the forms of love He wears,<br/>Exalted on His throne;<br/>In loftiest songs of sweetest praise,<br/>I would to everlasting days,<br/>Make all His glories known;<br/>Make all His glories known.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>Soon the delightful day will come,<br/>When my dear Lord will bring me home<br/>And I shall see His face;<br/>Then with my Savior brother friend,<br/>A blest eternity I'll spend,<br/>Triumphant in His grace;<br/>Triumphant in His grace.<br/>Amen.</lines>
