    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>I'd sing the precious blood He spilt, newline My ransom from the dreadful guilt newline Of sin, and wrath divine; newline I'd sing His glorious righteousness, newline In which all perfect, heavenly dress, newline My soul shall ever shine; newline My soul shall ever shine.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>I'd sing the characters He bears newline And all the forms of love He wears, newline Exalted on His throne; newline In loftiest songs of sweetest praise, newline I would to everlasting days, newline Make all His glories known; newline Make all His glories known.</lines>
