    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Children of the heavenly Father,<br/>Safely in His bosom gather;<br/>Nestling bird nor star in heaven<br/>Such a refuge e'er was given.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>God His own doth tend and nourish,<br/>In His holy courts they flourish;<br/>From all evil things He spares them,<br/>In His mighty arms He bears them.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>Neither life nor death shall ever,<br/>From the Lord His children sever;<br/>Unto them His grace He showeth,<br/>And their sorrows all He knoweth.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>Lo, their very hairs He numbers,<br/>And no daily care encumbers;<br/>Them that share His every blessing,<br/>And His help in woes distressing.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines>Praise the Lord in joyful numbers,<br/>Your protector never slumbers;<br/>At the will of your defender,<br/>Every foe man must surrender.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v6">
      <lines>Though He giveth or He taketh,<br/>God His children ne'er forsaketh;<br/>His the loving purpose solely<br/>To preserve them pure and holy.</lines>
    </verse>
