    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Children of the heavenly Father, newline Safely in His bosom gather; newline Nestling bird nor star in heaven newline Such a refuge e'er was given.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>God His own doth tend and nourish, newline In His holy courts they flourish; newline From all evil things He spares them, newline In His mighty arms He bears them.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>Neither life nor death shall ever, newline From the Lord His children sever; newline Unto them His grace He showeth, newline And their sorrows all He knoweth.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>Lo, their very hairs He numbers, newline And no daily care encumbers; newline Them that share His every blessing, newline And His help in woes distressing.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines>Praise the Lord in joyful numbers, newline Your protector never slumbers; newline At the will of your defender, newline Every foe man must surrender.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v6">
      <lines>Though He giveth or He taketh, newline God His children ne'er forsaketh; newline His the loving purpose solely newline To preserve them pure and holy.</lines>
