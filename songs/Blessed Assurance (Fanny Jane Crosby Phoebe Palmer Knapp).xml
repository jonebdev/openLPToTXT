    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Perfect submission, perfect delight!<br/>Visions of rapture now burst at my sight!<br/>Angels descending bring from above<br/>Echoes of mercy, whispers of love.</lines>

      <lines>Perfect submission, all is at rest.<br/>I in my Savior am happy and blest;<br/>Watching and waiting, looking above,<br/>Filled with His goodness, lost in His love.</lines>
