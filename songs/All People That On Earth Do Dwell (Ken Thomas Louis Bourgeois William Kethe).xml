    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>The Lord, ye know, is God indeed,<br/>Without our aid He did us make;<br/>We are His flock, He doth us fee<br/>And for His sheep He doth us take.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>O, enter then His gates with praise,<br/>Approach with joy His courts unto;<br/>Praise laud and bless His name always,<br/>For it is seemly so to do.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>For why the Lord our God is good,<br/>His mercy is forever sure;<br/>His truth at all times firmly stood,<br/>And shall from age to age endure.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines>Praise God from whom<br/>All blessings flow.<br/>Praise Him<br/>All creatures here below.<br/>Praise Him above<br/>Ye heav'nly host.<br/>Praise Father, Son,<br/>And Holy Ghost.</lines>
