    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>In the sweet by and by, newline In the sweet by and by, newline I'll stand at last on the street of pure gold, newline Wonders and glory of heav'n behold, newline In the sweet by and by, newline In the sweet by and by, newline Joy will be so complete when my Savior I meet, newline In the sweet by and by.</lines>
