    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>In the sweet by and by,<br/>In the sweet by and by,<br/>I'll have a mansion so bright and fair,<br/>Won't it be glorious when I get there,<br/>In the sweet by and by,<br/>In the sweet by and by,<br/>When the battle is done,<br/>And the vict'ry is won,<br/>In the sweet by and by.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>In the sweet by and by,<br/>In the sweet by and by,<br/>I'll stand at last on the street of pure gold,<br/>Wonders and glory of heav'n behold,<br/>In the sweet by and by,<br/>In the sweet by and by,<br/>Joy will be so complete when my Savior I meet,<br/>In the sweet by and by.</lines>
