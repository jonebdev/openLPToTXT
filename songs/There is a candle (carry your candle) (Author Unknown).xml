    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>There is a candle in every soul<br/>Some brightly burning some dark and cold<br/>There is a spirit who brings the fire<br/>Ignites a candle and makes his home</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Carry your candle run to the darkness<br/>Seek out the hopeless confused and torn<br/>Hold out your candle for all to see it<br/>Take your candle and go light your world</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>Frustrated brother see how he's tried to<br/>Light his own candle some other way<br/>See now our sister she's been robbed and lied to<br/>And still holds a candle without a flame</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>Carry your candle run to the darkness<br/>Seek out the lonely the tired and worn<br/>Hold out your candle for all to see it<br/>Take your candle and go light your world</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines>We are a family whose hearts are blazing<br/>We raise our candles and light up the sky<br/>Praying to our father in the name of Jesus<br/>Make us a beacon in darkest hours</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v6">
      <lines>Carry your candle run to the darkness<br/>Seek out the helpless deceived and poor<br/>Hold out your candle for all to see it<br/>Take your candle and go light your world<br/>Take your candle and go light your world</lines>
