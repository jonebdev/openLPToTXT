    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>And Though these are days of great trials,<br/>of famine and darkness and sword<br/>Still, we are the voice in the desert crying,<br/>"Prepare ye the way of the Lord!"</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>Behold He comes, riding on the cloud<br/>Shining like the sun, at the trumpet call<br/>So lift your voice, it's the year of jubilee,<br/>And out of Zion's hill, salvation comes.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>And these are the daus pf Ezekiel,<br/>The dry bones becoming as flesh.<br/>And these are the days of Your servant, David,<br/>Rebuilding the temple of praise.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines>And these are the days of the harvest,<br/>The fields are as white in the world.<br/>And we are the laborers in Your vineyard,<br/>declaring the word of the Lord!</lines>

    <verse name="v6">
      <lines>There's no one like Jehovah (4x)</lines>
