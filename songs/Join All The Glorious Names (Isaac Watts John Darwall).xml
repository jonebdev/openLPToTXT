    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">

    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>Jesus, my great High Priest, newline Offered His blood and died; newline My guilty conscience seeks newline No sacrifice beside; newline His powerful blood did once atone, newline And now it pleads before the throne.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>My Savior and my Lord, newline My Conqueror and my King; newline Thy scepter and Thy sword, newline Thy reigning grace I sing; newline Thine is the power behold I sit, newline In willing bonds beneath Thy feet.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines>Now let my soul arise newline And tread the tempter down; newline My Captain leads me forth, newline To conquest and a crown; newline A feeble saint shall win the day, newline Though death and hell obstruct the way.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v6">
      <lines>Should all the hosts of death newline And powers of hell unknown newline Put their most dreadful forms newline Of rage and malice on, newline I shall be safe for Christ displays, newline Superior power and guardian grace.</lines>
