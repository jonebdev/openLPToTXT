    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>A wonderful Savior is Jesus my Lord. newline He taketh my burden away. newline He holdeth me up newline And I shall not be moved. newline He giveth me strength as my day.</lines>

    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>With numberless blessings newline Each moment He crowns; newline And filled with His fullness divine, newline I sing in my rapture, "Oh, glory to God newline For such a Redeemer as mine!"</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>When clothed in His brightness newline Transported I rise, newline To meet Him in clouds of the sky, newline His perfect salvation, newline His wonderful love I'll shout newline With the millions on high.</lines>
