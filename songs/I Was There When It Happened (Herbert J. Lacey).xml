    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>I was there when it happened,<br/>And I ought to know,<br/>His Spirit burning in me,<br/>Set my heart aglow,<br/>So I praise the Lord today.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>You ask me how I know that Jesus saves me,<br/>How I know that all my sins are white as snow.<br/>You ask me how I know that He forgave me,<br/>Now listen I must tell you how I know.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>You ask me how I know that He redeemed me,<br/>And how I received the peace no gold can buy.<br/>How from the guilt and pow'r of sin He saved me,<br/>Made me an heir to mansions in the sky.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>And now as thru the world I go rejoicing,<br/>I am telling what a Savior dwells within.<br/>How I plunged into the cleansing crimson fountain,<br/>And Jesus washed my soul from ev'ry sin.</lines>
    </verse>
