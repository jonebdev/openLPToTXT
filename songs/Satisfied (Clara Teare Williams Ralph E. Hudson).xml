    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>Hallelujah! I have found Him newline Whom my soul so long has craved! newline Jesus satisfies my longings; newline Thro' His blood I now am saved.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>All my lifelong I had panted, newline For a draught from some cool spring newline That I hoped would quench the burning newline Of the thirst I felt within.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Feeding on the husks around me newline Till my strength was almost gone, newline Longed my soul for something better, newline Only still to hunger on.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>Poor I was and sought for riches, newline Something that would satisfy; newline But the dust I gathered round me newline Only mocked my soul's sad cry.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>Well of water, ever springing, newline Bread of life, so rich and free, newline Untold wealth that never faileth, newline My Redeemer is to me.</lines>
    </verse>
