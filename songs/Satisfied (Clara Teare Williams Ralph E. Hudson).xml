    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>Hallelujah! I have found Him<br/>Whom my soul so long has craved!<br/>Jesus satisfies my longings;<br/>Thro' His blood I now am saved.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>All my lifelong I had panted,<br/>For a draught from some cool spring<br/>That I hoped would quench the burning<br/>Of the thirst I felt within.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Feeding on the husks around me<br/>Till my strength was almost gone,<br/>Longed my soul for something better,<br/>Only still to hunger on.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>Poor I was and sought for riches,<br/>Something that would satisfy;<br/>But the dust I gathered round me<br/>Only mocked my soul's sad cry.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>Well of water, ever springing,<br/>Bread of life, so rich and free,<br/>Untold wealth that never faileth,<br/>My Redeemer is to me.</lines>
    </verse>
