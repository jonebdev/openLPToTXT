    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>You called my name, reached out your hand<br/>Restored my life, and I was redeemed<br/>The moment you entered my life</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Amazing grace, Christ gave that day<br/>My life was changed when from my shoulders<br/>Fell the weight of my sin</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>So it's with everything I am<br/>I reach out for your hand<br/>The hope for change<br/>The second chance I've gained</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>On you I throw my life<br/>Casting all my fears aside<br/>Hoe could greater love than this<br/>Ever possibly exist</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines>Consume my thoughts<br/>As I rest in You<br/>I'm now in love with a Saviour<br/>Bearing the marks of His love</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v6">
      <lines>So I'll wait upon you now<br/>With my hands released to You<br/>Where a little faith's enough<br/>To see mountains lift and move<br/>And I'll wait upon you now<br/>Dedicated to Your will<br/>A love that never fails</lines>
