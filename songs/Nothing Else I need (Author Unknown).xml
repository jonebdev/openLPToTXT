    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>When I think of all I've done<br/>Nothing compares to what you give<br/>And to drink of what you bring<br/>You quench the thirst for me to live<br/>I am satisfied by what<br/>Tenderness you've shown to me<br/>And I empty all that I am</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>And you fill my life<br/>You're everything to me<br/>There's nothing else I need anymore<br/>And I know you're everything to me<br/>And there's nothing else I need anymore</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>I have tasted and I know<br/>This fire birthed inside will only grow<br/>And I've sought all that this world<br/>Tried to offer me<br/>And it led me to your feet<br/>And I empty all that I am</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>I will lay down all my needs<br/>And you will come and make them new<br/>To make you my only desire<br/>My desire</lines>
    </verse>
