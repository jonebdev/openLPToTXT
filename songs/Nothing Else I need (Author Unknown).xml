    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>And you fill my life newline You're everything to me newline There's nothing else I need anymore newline And I know you're everything to me newline And there's nothing else I need anymore</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>I have tasted and I know newline This fire birthed inside will only grow newline And I've sought all that this world newline Tried to offer me newline And it led me to your feet newline And I empty all that I am</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>I will lay down all my needs newline And you will come and make them new newline To make you my only desire newline My desire</lines>
