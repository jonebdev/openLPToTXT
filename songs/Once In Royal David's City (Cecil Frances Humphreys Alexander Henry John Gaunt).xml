    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Once in royal David's city,<br/>Stood a lowly cattle shed;<br/>Where a mother laid her baby,<br/>In a manger for His bed.<br/>Mary was that mother mild,<br/>Jesus Christ, her little Child.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>He came down to earth from heaven,<br/>Who is God and Lord of all;<br/>And His shelter was a stable,<br/>And His cradle was a stall.<br/>With the poor and meek and lowly,<br/>Lived on earth, our Savior holy.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>Jesus is our childhood's pattern,<br/>Day by day like us He grew;<br/>He was little, weak and helpless,<br/>Tears and smiles like us He knew.<br/>And He feels for all our sadness,<br/>And He shares in all our gladness.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>And our eyes at last shall see Him,<br/>Through His own redeeming love,<br/>For that Child so dear and gentle,<br/>Is our Lord in heaven above;<br/>And He leads His children on,<br/>To the place where He has gone.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines>Not in that poor lowly stable,<br/>With the oxen standing by;<br/>We shall see Him but in heaven,<br/>Set at God's right hand on high.<br/>There His children gather round,<br/>Bright like stars with glory crowned.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v6">
      <lines>And through all<br/>His wondrous childhood<br/>He would honor and obey,<br/>Love and watch the lowly maiden<br/>In whose gentle arms He lay;<br/>Christian children,<br/>All must be mild, obedient,<br/>Good as He.</lines>
    </verse>
