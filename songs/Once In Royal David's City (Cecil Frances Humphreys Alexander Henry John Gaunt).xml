    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Once in royal David's city, newline Stood a lowly cattle shed; newline Where a mother laid her baby, newline In a manger for His bed. newline Mary was that mother mild, newline Jesus Christ, her little Child.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>He came down to earth from heaven, newline Who is God and Lord of all; newline And His shelter was a stable, newline And His cradle was a stall. newline With the poor and meek and lowly, newline Lived on earth, our Savior holy.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>Jesus is our childhood's pattern, newline Day by day like us He grew; newline He was little, weak and helpless, newline Tears and smiles like us He knew. newline And He feels for all our sadness, newline And He shares in all our gladness.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>And our eyes at last shall see Him, newline Through His own redeeming love, newline For that Child so dear and gentle, newline Is our Lord in heaven above; newline And He leads His children on, newline To the place where He has gone.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines>Not in that poor lowly stable, newline With the oxen standing by; newline We shall see Him but in heaven, newline Set at God's right hand on high. newline There His children gather round, newline Bright like stars with glory crowned.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v6">
      <lines>And through all newline His wondrous childhood newline He would honor and obey, newline Love and watch the lowly maiden newline In whose gentle arms He lay; newline Christian children, newline All must be mild, obedient, newline Good as He.</lines>
    </verse>
