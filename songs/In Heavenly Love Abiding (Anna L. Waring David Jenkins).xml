    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>In heavenly love abiding, newline No change my heart shall fear; newline And safe is such confiding, newline For nothing changes here: newline The storm may roar without me, newline My heart may low be laid; newline But God is round about me, newline And can I be dismayed?</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Wherever He may guide me, newline No want shall turn me back; newline My Shepherd is beside me, newline And nothing can I lack: newline His wisdom ever waketh, newline His sight is never dim; newline He knows the way He taketh, newline And I will walk with Him.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>Green pastures are before me, newline Which yet I have not seen; newline Bright skies will soon be o'er me, newline Where darkest clouds have been; newline My hope I cannot measure, newline My path to life is free; newline My Saviour has my treasure, newline And He will walkt with me.</lines>
    </verse>
