    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>Grace, grace, God's grace, newline Grace that will pardon and cleanse within! newline Grace, grace, God's grace, newline Grace that is greater than all our sin!</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Marvelous grace of our loving Lord, newline Grace that exceeds our sin and our guilt, newline Yonder on Calvary's mount outpoured, newline There where the blood of the Lamb was spilt!</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Sin and despair, like the sea waves cold, newline Threaten the soul with infinite loss. newline Grace that is greater, yes, grace untold, newline Points to the refuge, the mighty Cross.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>Dark is the stain that we cannot hide. newline What can avail to wash it away? newline Look! There is flowing a crimson tide; newline Whiter than snow you may be today.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>Marvelous, infinite, matchless grace, newline Freely bestowed on all who believe! newline You that are longing to see His face, newline Will you this moment His grace receive?</lines>
