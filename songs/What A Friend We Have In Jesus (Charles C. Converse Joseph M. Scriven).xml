    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>What a Friend we have in Jesus, newline All our sins and griefs to bear! newline What a privilege to carry, newline Everything to God in prayer! newline Oh, what peace we often forfeit, newline Oh, what needless pain we bear. newline All because we do not carry newline Everything to God in prayer!</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Have we trials and temptations? newline Is there trouble anywhere? newline We should never be discouraged; newline Take it to the Lord in prayer. newline Can we find a friend so faithful, newline Who will all our sorrows share? newline Jesus knows our every weakness; newline Take it to the Lord in prayer.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>Are we weak and heavy laden, newline Cumbered with a load of care? newline Precious Savior, still our refuge! newline Take it to the Lord in prayer. newline Do Thy friends despise forsake Thee? newline Take it to the Lord in prayer. newline In His arms He'll take and shield Thee; newline Thou wilt find a solace there.</lines>
