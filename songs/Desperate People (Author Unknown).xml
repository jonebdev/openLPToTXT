    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>You crossed the great divide,<br/>You took our place,<br/>You offered up Your life though we have failed<br/>The veil was torn and love remained<br/>You are Holy, Lord.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Distraction costs us, how we seek your face<br/>We offer up our lives to bring you praise<br/>A love the walls cannot contain<br/>You are holy Lord</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>We're rising up in Spirit<br/>and in truth<br/>A living sacrifice<br/>We worship You<br/>People undivided, Lord hear us sing<br/>We are yours and You are our King.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>This is our love,<br/>Hearts joined as one<br/>Desperate for all your are<br/>Lord break down these walls<br/>And see how we love<br/>Desperate for all you are<br/>We chase Your heart</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">

    <verse name="v6">
      <lines>Show us the way to your heart,<br/>We found our voice<br/>we found our cause<br/>we're on our knees, the carper's worm<br/>We join our hearts<br/>with distant shores and sing to you Lord.</lines>
